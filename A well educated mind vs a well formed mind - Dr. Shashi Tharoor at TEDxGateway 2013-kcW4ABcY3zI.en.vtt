00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.331
I'm here to talk to you about
Indian education,

00:00:13.332 --> 00:00:14.983
higher education in particular.

00:00:14.984 --> 00:00:17.579
But I'm actually going to
start with demography.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.586
How many of you here are under 35?

00:00:21.936 --> 00:00:25.616
OK, that seems pretty
representative of the country;

00:00:25.617 --> 00:00:28.077
65% of India is under 35.

00:00:28.078 --> 00:00:29.940
How many of you are under 25?

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.182
Then you are not representing

00:00:33.183 --> 00:00:37.624
because half of the Indian population
is pretty much under 25.

00:00:37.625 --> 00:00:40.325
We are an amazingly young country.

00:00:40.326 --> 00:00:43.422
In fact, if you just take
the age group from 10 to 19,

00:00:43.423 --> 00:00:48.288
there are 226 million Indians,
poised, in other words, to enter

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.043
higher education, going through school
and ready for higher education.

00:00:52.044 --> 00:00:53.063
This is amazing

00:00:53.064 --> 00:00:56.434
because it's happening at the time
when the rest of the world is aging.

00:00:56.435 --> 00:00:59.591
If you look at the average age
in India today, it's 28.

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:02.997
Of course, don't ask about the gap
- since we heard about gaps -

00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:06.212
between the average age
of the Indian person

00:01:06.213 --> 00:01:07.895
and of the Indian cabinet.

00:01:07.896 --> 00:01:10.018
I think we hold the world record for that.

00:01:10.019 --> 00:01:14.469
But, that's another TED talk, right?

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.958
But what you've got
with the average ages

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:19.254
at a time when the rest
of the world is changing,

00:01:19.255 --> 00:01:22.160
is that by 2020, the average age
in Japan is going to be 47,

00:01:22.161 --> 00:01:25.161
in China it's going to be
heading well past 40,

00:01:25.162 --> 00:01:29.307
Europe, 46, the United States,
beautiful US, also 40,

00:01:29.308 --> 00:01:32.206
and India's average age
is going to be 29.

00:01:32.207 --> 00:01:34.395
So we are potentially the people

00:01:34.396 --> 00:01:38.644
who are youthful, productive,
dynamic, young population,

00:01:38.645 --> 00:01:41.949
ready to work, and transform
the world, the kinds of role that, say,

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.895
China played in the last generation
could be ours in the next.

00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:48.752
In fact, International Labor Organization
has worked out that by 2020,

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:52.999
we'll have 160 million people
in the age group of starting work,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.170
- 20 to 24 is what they calculate -

00:01:55.172 --> 00:01:59.182
and China will only have 94 million,
at the same time.

00:01:59.183 --> 00:02:01.118
So we really are poised to do that.

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.524
But, and by the way, other countries
will have a serious deficit

00:02:04.525 --> 00:02:08.562
that's estimated
that the US will have 17 million short

00:02:08.564 --> 00:02:11.101
in terms of how many people
they need of working age.

00:02:11.102 --> 00:02:13.275
We, in India, have the people.

00:02:13.276 --> 00:02:17.919
But do we have the ability to equip
the people to take advantage of this,

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.519
to be the workforce
of the work engine for the world?

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.361
See, if we get it right, we educate
and train them, we really transform

00:02:24.362 --> 00:02:27.763
not just our own economy
and our society, but the world.

00:02:27.764 --> 00:02:31.103
If we get it wrong,
the demographic dividend

00:02:31.104 --> 00:02:34.428
that I'm talking about becomes
a demographic disaster.

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:39.255
Because, we've already seen
in 165 of our 625 districts

00:02:39.256 --> 00:02:45.342
what happens when unemployed,
frustrated, undereducated young man

00:02:45.343 --> 00:02:48.513
become prey to
the blandishments of the Maoists

00:02:48.514 --> 00:02:50.540
and prey to the gun and the bullet.

00:02:50.541 --> 00:02:55.249
So education in our country is
not just a social or economic issue,

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.784
it's even a national security issue.

00:02:57.785 --> 00:03:00.145
We've got equip our people

00:03:00.146 --> 00:03:03.163
to take advantage
of what the 21st century offers them.

00:03:03.164 --> 00:03:06.882
This is the story in a nutshell:

00:03:06.883 --> 00:03:10.870
4 E's, Expansion with our
first priority in education.

00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:12.330
Why? Because the British

00:03:12.331 --> 00:03:14.826
- and I wouldn't even ask
if any of you are here -

00:03:14.827 --> 00:03:19.041
left us in 1947, with a 16% literacy rate.

00:03:19.042 --> 00:03:23.918
there were only 400,000 four-lakh students
in the entire country in higher education.

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:28.353
We had 26 universities,
fewer than 700 colleges.

00:03:28.354 --> 00:03:30.890
So obviously, expansion was essential;

00:03:30.891 --> 00:03:34.359
we've gone right from that 16%
to 74% literacy today,

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.632
we've gone from 26 universities
to 650 universities,

00:03:38.633 --> 00:03:42.290
we've gone from those
400,000 students, four-lakh students,

00:03:42.291 --> 00:03:45.613
to 20 million students
in higher education today,

00:03:45.614 --> 00:03:52.104
and we have 35,000 colleges as well,
instead of 700 colleges we had then.

00:03:52.105 --> 00:03:53.837
So expansion has taken place.

00:03:53.838 --> 00:03:57.251
We've also had to fight
for the second E of Equity.

00:03:57.261 --> 00:03:59.818
That is, including the excluded
from the education,

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.121
trying to reach out to the unreached,

00:04:02.122 --> 00:04:04.601
the people who didn't get
a fair shake in education

00:04:04.602 --> 00:04:07.372
for reasons they couldn't help:
gender, an obvious reason.

00:04:07.373 --> 00:04:09.501
When we had had that 16% literacy rate,

00:04:09.501 --> 00:04:11.687
do you know what
the female literacy rate was?

00:04:11.688 --> 00:04:14.710
8.9% at the time of the independence.

00:04:14.711 --> 00:04:18.442
Just one out of 11 Indian women
could read and write.

00:04:18.444 --> 00:04:22.676
Caste, region, religion, all sorts
people got left out of system.

00:04:22.677 --> 00:04:24.176
We had to bring them in.

00:04:24.177 --> 00:04:27.250
And that became a big challenge
and a priority for education.

00:04:27.251 --> 00:04:29.848
In getting those two things
more or less right,

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:32.214
I don't know how well
we did on the third E,

00:04:32.215 --> 00:04:34.071
which is the E of Excellence.

00:04:34.072 --> 00:04:36.070
Obviously, you need quality.

00:04:36.071 --> 00:04:40.089
And we set about setting up institutions
of great quality in our country.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.375
The IITs are a good example, in fact,
it's part of Jawaharlal Nehru's vision

00:04:45.375 --> 00:04:50.401
that IIT in Kharagpur was
established in 1956, the year I was born,

00:04:50.402 --> 00:04:53.725
and it was done on the site
of a British detention center,

00:04:53.726 --> 00:04:55.834
the Hijili detention center.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.595
So a symbol of political oppression
became instead a symbol of hope,

00:04:59.596 --> 00:05:01.857
of technology, of looking to the future.

00:05:01.876 --> 00:05:04.900
But, for the IITs, the IIMs,
a few good institutions,

00:05:04.901 --> 00:05:07.880
I'm sure you could all pick
your few around the country,

00:05:07.881 --> 00:05:10.180
these have tended to be
islands of excellence

00:05:10.181 --> 00:05:12.661
floating on the sea of mediocrity.

00:05:12.662 --> 00:05:17.823
The average Indian higher education
institution is simply not of the quality

00:05:17.824 --> 00:05:21.484
that you and I, all of us,
in this audience would like to see.

00:05:21.501 --> 00:05:26.364
And that ties into the fourth E I've added
to this catechism: Employability.

00:05:26.365 --> 00:05:29.722
Talk to employers, talk to CEOs,
what would they tell you?

00:05:29.723 --> 00:05:31.401
That they're simply not satisfied

00:05:31.402 --> 00:05:33.874
with the quality
of the graduates they're getting.

00:05:33.876 --> 00:05:36.794
Even in the T of TED,
the technological area,

00:05:36.801 --> 00:05:40.458
engineering graduates, half a million
engineering graduates a year,

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:44.404
but if you talk to the Federation of
Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry,

00:05:44.405 --> 00:05:48.256
they did a survey and 64%
of employers are not satisfied

00:05:48.257 --> 00:05:50.555
with the quality of graduates
they're getting.

00:05:50.556 --> 00:05:54.528
Some companies are running,
essentially, re-education places,

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:57.096
like the gigantic campus in Mysore.

00:05:57.097 --> 00:06:00.870
And it's not on the job training
which big companies tend to do,

00:06:00.871 --> 00:06:06.260
it is, in fact, a full-year's education
for the people they've already hired,

00:06:06.261 --> 00:06:08.370
to make up for the deficiencies

00:06:08.371 --> 00:06:11.556
of what they've learned
or not properly learned in the college.

00:06:11.557 --> 00:06:14.987
Now, that's the scale
of the challenge that we face.

00:06:14.988 --> 00:06:18.055
What are we doing about it?
A great deal needs to be done.

00:06:18.056 --> 00:06:23.094
Of course, we are trying to put in
kids into the system at an early age,

00:06:23.095 --> 00:06:25.834
the RTE, the Right to Education Act,

00:06:25.835 --> 00:06:27.954
if kids were out of school
in the old days,

00:06:27.955 --> 00:06:29.388
it was their parents' fault;

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:32.001
today, if there are out of school
it's a state's fault.

00:06:32.002 --> 00:06:35.940
The government is committed
to actually getting them an education.

00:06:35.941 --> 00:06:37.760
We've got more and more money

00:06:37.761 --> 00:06:40.030
being pumped in
by the system at all levels.

00:06:40.031 --> 00:06:43.489
For example, many of you
may have gone to prestigious universities;

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.086
lots of people in India don't.

00:06:45.087 --> 00:06:48.121
They go to state universities
which are grossly under-financed.

00:06:48.122 --> 00:06:51.848
We've come up with a scheme to pump
central money into the state universities,

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:54.668
so they actually have
the resources to do something

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:56.428
with the students they have there.

00:06:56.429 --> 00:06:57.872
Money isn't the whole answer.

00:06:57.873 --> 00:07:01.876
There is an entire challenge,
in terms of addressing things

00:07:01.877 --> 00:07:05.023
like the gender gap - that's a gap,
but despite what mister...

00:07:05.024 --> 00:07:08.392
or what an earlier speaker said,
we don't want to embrace, right? -

00:07:08.393 --> 00:07:10.850
that we must, must overcome.

00:07:10.851 --> 00:07:16.804
Right now, women's literacy is 66%,
better than the 8.9, but it still means

00:07:16.805 --> 00:07:20.420
that, you know, one out of every
3 Indian women still can't read and write.

00:07:20.421 --> 00:07:22.173
We have to overcome that.

00:07:22.174 --> 00:07:25.218
And we need to catch the ones
who've been left out of the net:

00:07:25.219 --> 00:07:26.962
adult literacy; huge challenge.

00:07:26.963 --> 00:07:30.168
I went off to a village in Tamil Nadu,
not far from Khan Jibran,

00:07:30.176 --> 00:07:32.685
but I've met women,
who in their 50s and 60s,

00:07:32.686 --> 00:07:34.233
were learning to read and write.

00:07:34.234 --> 00:07:36.355
And people think sometimes
what's the point,

00:07:36.356 --> 00:07:39.859
some of their own family members,
their husbands, think what's the point.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.139
The answer is it changes their lives,
it empowers them in real ways.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.164
I spoke to a woman called Chitra Mani,

00:07:45.165 --> 00:07:48.530
who proudly wrote her name
in Tamil on a piece of paper.

00:07:48.531 --> 00:07:52.229
I said: "So, what does being able
to read and write mean to you?"

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:56.146
And she said: "Now I can see
the destination of a bus,

00:07:56.147 --> 00:07:57.549
where it's going;

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:00.099
I don't need to ask somebody
where that bus is going.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.291
I know where I can go.

00:08:01.292 --> 00:08:03.334
When I get to the big city
of Gandhi Puram,

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:06.179
I can read the street signs,
I can find where I need to go,

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.728
I don't feel helpless anymore."

00:08:07.729 --> 00:08:11.374
That kind of empowerment is
what literacy gives people

00:08:11.375 --> 00:08:14.117
in a very fundamental and real way.

00:08:14.118 --> 00:08:18.084
And we're trying to do that of course,
for those who've dropped out early on,

00:08:18.085 --> 00:08:20.796
in the days before we got to that 74%.

00:08:20.797 --> 00:08:23.773
Younger kids, we've got them
into school now.

00:08:23.773 --> 00:08:26.027
We've something called
a gross enrollment ratio,

00:08:26.028 --> 00:08:28.497
the percentage of children
of a certain age,

00:08:28.498 --> 00:08:31.367
of the appropriate one
for a particular level of education.

00:08:31.368 --> 00:08:35.873
But at our primary school now,
our gross enrollment ratio is 116%.

00:08:35.874 --> 00:08:39.725
We've actually enrolled more kids
than we thought existed at that age group,

00:08:39.726 --> 00:08:42.140
because some of the older ones
are coming in too.

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:45.290
Bad news is, as you go
up the level, it starts dropping,

00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:49.200
So by the 8th grade,
I'm afraid it's down to 69%,

00:08:49.201 --> 00:08:53.511
by the 10th grade, 39%,

00:08:53.512 --> 00:08:57.199
and by college, our gross enrollment
ratio is about 18%,

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.503
against the global average of 29%.

00:08:59.504 --> 00:09:03.121
So, clearly, we still need to do more.
Our expansion hasn't gone enough.

00:09:03.122 --> 00:09:06.283
We haven't managed to get
everyone to stay in the system.

00:09:06.284 --> 00:09:08.749
Some of them actually
need vocational training.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:12.451
They're not all going to become
white collar clerks,

00:09:12.459 --> 00:09:15.150
or officials, or IAS officers, right?

00:09:15.151 --> 00:09:19.571
We need to try and catch them,
and get them into vocational training.

00:09:19.572 --> 00:09:22.785
But how do you do that in the culture
where, for 3,000 years,

00:09:22.786 --> 00:09:25.195
if you wanted to become
a cobbler or a carpenter,

00:09:25.196 --> 00:09:28.586
you'd better have an uncle or father
who's a cobbler or a carpenter,

00:09:28.587 --> 00:09:30.585
because nobody else is going to teach you.

00:09:30.585 --> 00:09:33.480
The transmission of knowledge,
of trade craft in our country,

00:09:33.481 --> 00:09:35.400
has always been through the gene pool,

00:09:35.401 --> 00:09:39.240
the reason why the sons of politicians
tend to be politicians also, you know.

00:09:39.241 --> 00:09:43.214
And with the Bollywood movies stars,
same story. (Laughter)

00:09:43.215 --> 00:09:45.249
So we need to get master craftsmen.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:50.240
Why is it with a country of 1.2 billion
that we should have a nationwide shortage

00:09:50.249 --> 00:09:53.318
of masons, of plumbers,
of certified electricians?

00:09:53.319 --> 00:09:56.046
We need to get more
vocational training into the system,

00:09:56.047 --> 00:09:59.788
we're doing that, we're now rolling out
the whole concept of community colleges

00:09:59.788 --> 00:10:02.240
so that kids can go in,
have some academic learning,

00:10:02.241 --> 00:10:04.360
lots of vocational training,

00:10:04.361 --> 00:10:07.534
and at the end of 2 years, if they show
tremendous academic promise

00:10:07.535 --> 00:10:09.659
they can go back to a university, if not,

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:13.250
they leave with a 2-year certificate,
and they go off and do a useful trade

00:10:13.251 --> 00:10:15.660
in a society that is clamoring
for these skills.

00:10:15.661 --> 00:10:17.542
So these are the kinds of changes

00:10:17.543 --> 00:10:20.162
that we're trying to bring about,
and move along.

00:10:20.163 --> 00:10:23.244
But there's a change that
the government alone can't do.

00:10:23.245 --> 00:10:26.161
You know, if you look at the need
for research and innovation,

00:10:26.162 --> 00:10:29.611
- you've heard a lot of that, I'm sure
in the course of the TED talks -

00:10:29.612 --> 00:10:32.381
research is something which...

00:10:32.382 --> 00:10:34.877
The government wants to double
the amount of money

00:10:34.878 --> 00:10:37.877
they are spending on research
for 1% of GDP to 2%;

00:10:37.878 --> 00:10:40.329
we haven't had the money
to pump into it yet,

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:44.741
but, innovation requires
new ways of thinking.

00:10:44.742 --> 00:10:47.675
I heard you had a talk about
hyper-thinking; I've missed it.

00:10:47.676 --> 00:10:50.962
But new ways of thinking means
learning to think out of the box,

00:10:50.963 --> 00:10:53.918
learning to create, I know we're
famous for ”jugaad”, right?

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:55.979
If you Google the word
'frugal innovation, '

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.759
and top 20 hits will all relate to
Indian inventions.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.693
We invented the world's
cheapest electrocardiogram,

00:11:01.694 --> 00:11:05.550
the simplest and cheapest EKG,
the cheapest insulin injection,

00:11:05.551 --> 00:11:08.958
the world's cheapest small car,
the TATA Nano,

00:11:08.959 --> 00:11:11.710
but all these've been things
invented elsewhere

00:11:11.755 --> 00:11:15.164
that we have stripped down,
made more affordable, more replicable,

00:11:15.165 --> 00:11:16.794
more relevant to our conditions.

00:11:16.795 --> 00:11:19.330
We need to do things
that others haven't done before,

00:11:19.334 --> 00:11:22.707
which we used to do in our culture
where Nalanda invented the zero.

00:11:22.708 --> 00:11:26.594
Remember how the Romans used to write
their numerals in long strings of letters,

00:11:26.595 --> 00:11:31.085
till an Indian thought of the idea of zero
emerging from the notion of "śūnyatā"

00:11:31.112 --> 00:11:33.500
in Hindu and Buddhist thinking?

00:11:33.501 --> 00:11:37.910
That came into the zero "śūnya"
which transformed global mathematics.

00:11:37.911 --> 00:11:41.149
We need to think like that again;
we need to come up with ideas.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:44.972
With 17% of the world's brains,
why do we only have 2.8%

00:11:44.973 --> 00:11:47.986
of the world's research output
coming out of our country?

00:11:47.987 --> 00:11:52.388
Well, perhaps we need to start
in the classroom.

00:11:52.389 --> 00:11:56.643
Get our kids, not just to
have their heads filled full of facts,

00:11:56.644 --> 00:11:59.265
and textbook materials,
and teachers' lectures.

00:11:59.266 --> 00:12:01.900
Because frankly, that gives you
a well-filled mind,

00:12:01.901 --> 00:12:05.075
but in the era of the Internet,
you don't need a well-filled mind,

00:12:05.076 --> 00:12:06.735
you've got Google, right?

00:12:06.736 --> 00:12:09.180
Find everything you want
with 2 clicks of the mouse.

00:12:09.181 --> 00:12:11.160
What you need is a well-formed mind.

00:12:11.161 --> 00:12:14.400
A mind that reacts
to unfamiliar facts and details

00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:18.449
that can actually synthesize information
that it hasn't studied before.

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:22.898
A mind, in other words, that can react
to the bigger examination called 'life, '

00:12:22.899 --> 00:12:26.721
which doesn't actually only give you
the things you're prepared for.

00:12:26.722 --> 00:12:30.042
And for that you need a mind
that's shaped by original thinking,

00:12:30.043 --> 00:12:33.108
a mind that doesn't just ask
the teacher, "Why?", but "Why not?"

00:12:33.109 --> 00:12:36.681
I've actually had a little experience
of out of the box thinking myself.

00:12:36.682 --> 00:12:40.395
I wear glasses, I don't need them to read
or to see you folks on the front,

00:12:40.396 --> 00:12:42.685
but if I want to catch
somebody in the back row,

00:12:42.686 --> 00:12:44.523
there I have to look though glasses.

00:12:44.524 --> 00:12:48.121
But because I hardly ever wear them,
I keep losing or breaking them.

00:12:48.122 --> 00:12:51.421
I shove them in the pocket,
bang them against the wall or something,

00:12:51.422 --> 00:12:54.601
they crack, I put them on the lap,
when I get up, they fall down,

00:12:54.602 --> 00:12:56.565
somebody steps on them, they break.

00:12:56.566 --> 00:13:00.074
In the first 3 months of this year,
I lost or broke 6 pairs of glasses.

00:13:00.075 --> 00:13:01.884
So I was telling a friend about this,

00:13:01.885 --> 00:13:04.963
and he said: "A simple solution,
why can't you think of one?"

00:13:04.964 --> 00:13:07.033
I said: "Look, there is no easy solution

00:13:07.034 --> 00:13:10.172
because for 150 years,
glasses have been made in one way, right?

00:13:10.173 --> 00:13:12.947
They join together at the center,
then hang over your ears.

00:13:12.947 --> 00:13:15.821
That's what I've found
an inconvenience, so I take them off."

00:13:15.822 --> 00:13:18.921
And he said, "No, no, no, no, no,
you will find a different way.

00:13:18.922 --> 00:13:22.561
You can re-imagine glasses in a way
they're not going to hang over your ears,

00:13:22.562 --> 00:13:25.186
or join at the middle,"
and this is what he did.

00:13:25.187 --> 00:13:28.750
I'm wearing them right now;
and if I want to see anybody at the back,

00:13:28.751 --> 00:13:30.539
I just pull them together,

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:33.499
it has two magnets
in the middle that click together,

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.090
and I can see you all at the back.
(Applause)

00:13:36.091 --> 00:13:38.469
Now, it's just a silly example perhaps,

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:41.428
but it's an example
of how one can think out of the box.

00:13:41.429 --> 00:13:44.130
Things, familiar objects can be thought of

00:13:44.131 --> 00:13:46.840
in ways they haven't been
thought of before.

00:13:46.841 --> 00:13:49.989
And that way, we can move
forward in the world.

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:52.529
I have no doubt
that the challenges are enormous,

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:56.392
there is simply no question
that here, in our country,

00:13:56.393 --> 00:13:59.260
we have to become literate.

00:13:59.261 --> 00:14:01.200
But there's one piece of good news.

00:14:01.201 --> 00:14:06.292
95% of our 12 year-olds
across India can read and write.

00:14:06.293 --> 00:14:08.774
So the future looks good.

00:14:08.775 --> 00:14:11.167
And as far as the workforce is concerned,

00:14:11.168 --> 00:14:13.547
if we can get all
these other pieces in place,

00:14:13.548 --> 00:14:17.399
we can say to the rest
of the world, "We are coming."

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.981
Thank you very much.

00:14:18.982 --> 00:14:20.532
(Applause)
