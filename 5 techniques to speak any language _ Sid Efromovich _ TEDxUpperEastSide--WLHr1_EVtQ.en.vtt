00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.883
I speak seven languages.

00:00:06.883 --> 00:00:09.460
As soon as people find out about that,

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.721
what I'm most often asked --

00:00:11.721 --> 00:00:13.693
other than for my phone number --

00:00:13.693 --> 00:00:16.042
is: "How did you do it?

00:00:16.042 --> 00:00:20.395
How did you go about learning
all these different languages?"

00:00:20.395 --> 00:00:24.255
Well, today I'm going to
share with you some answers.

00:00:24.255 --> 00:00:26.438
So my phone number is 212...

00:00:26.438 --> 00:00:27.551
(Laughter)

00:00:27.551 --> 00:00:28.704
I'm just kidding.

00:00:28.704 --> 00:00:30.743
See, I was raised as a polyglot.

00:00:30.743 --> 00:00:33.288
And by the time I turned 18,

00:00:33.288 --> 00:00:36.312
I could speak already
four different languages.

00:00:36.312 --> 00:00:38.663
And then for the subsequent three years,

00:00:38.663 --> 00:00:40.668
I learned three additional languages.

00:00:40.668 --> 00:00:43.290
It's about those 3 years
that I want to talk about.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.094
Because my language acquisition process

00:00:46.094 --> 00:00:48.758
was very different from that of my peers,

00:00:48.758 --> 00:00:51.235
in that it was never of these stressful,

00:00:51.235 --> 00:00:54.842
strenuous, difficult,
seemingly impossible tasks,

00:00:54.842 --> 00:00:58.279
but rather something
enjoyable, fun, exciting.

00:00:58.279 --> 00:01:01.232
I loved it, every single moment of it.

00:01:02.612 --> 00:01:05.057
And I want to share with you

00:01:05.057 --> 00:01:08.308
why, what was it that made it so special.

00:01:08.308 --> 00:01:10.784
See, I did have a head start,

00:01:10.784 --> 00:01:14.840
in that I did have these four languages
that I spoke ahead of time.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.326
But there were also these 5 techniques,

00:01:17.326 --> 00:01:20.569
5 skills if you will, that I use

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:23.851
that made the language
learning process so much easier.

00:01:23.851 --> 00:01:25.708
And it's about those 5 techniques

00:01:25.708 --> 00:01:27.753
that I want to talk about.

00:01:27.753 --> 00:01:29.883
So let's dig right in.

00:01:29.883 --> 00:01:31.292
And for the first one,

00:01:31.292 --> 00:01:33.487
the first thing that we've got to do

00:01:33.487 --> 00:01:37.073
is to take a very deep breath.

00:01:41.593 --> 00:01:43.483
And relax.

00:01:43.483 --> 00:01:46.407
And the reason for it
is because our entire lives,

00:01:46.407 --> 00:01:49.249
we're taught how to do things right.

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:51.370
From the moment we were born we're taught

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.471
what things we should do,
things we shouldn't do,

00:01:54.471 --> 00:01:57.142
and how to do things properly.

00:01:57.142 --> 00:01:59.625
Well, when it comes to language learning,

00:01:59.625 --> 00:02:01.833
the golden rule of language learning,

00:02:01.833 --> 00:02:04.131
the most important thing,

00:02:04.131 --> 00:02:07.087
is to get things wrong,

00:02:07.087 --> 00:02:09.173
to make mistakes,

00:02:09.173 --> 00:02:11.081
and that is the first rule.

00:02:11.081 --> 00:02:12.893
Let me explain to you why.

00:02:12.893 --> 00:02:14.923
See, when we've known languages,

00:02:14.923 --> 00:02:17.118
we know a whole collection of sounds

00:02:17.118 --> 00:02:19.785
and a whole collection of structures,

00:02:19.785 --> 00:02:22.437
which combined make what I like to call --

00:02:22.437 --> 00:02:24.587
and for the purpose
of this presentation --

00:02:24.587 --> 00:02:26.825
our "'language database."

00:02:26.825 --> 00:02:28.879
And our language database will contain

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.923
all the sounds and structures
that we know.

00:02:30.923 --> 00:02:33.649
However, there is a whole family
of sounds and structures

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:36.478
that are beyond our database.

00:02:36.478 --> 00:02:41.902
And for us to be able to embark on those
and to be able to explore those,

00:02:41.902 --> 00:02:44.526
there is nothing within our database,

00:02:44.526 --> 00:02:46.329
nothing within our knowledge

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:49.377
that will tell us when
we're getting the structures right,

00:02:49.377 --> 00:02:52.952
nothing to tell us
when that sound is precise.

00:02:52.952 --> 00:02:56.277
Let's say we're going to explore
this one specific sound.

00:02:56.277 --> 00:02:58.568
There is nothing in our database.

00:02:58.568 --> 00:03:01.317
When we say it, we could say it perfectly,

00:03:01.317 --> 00:03:05.533
but in our minds,
it will sound like a mistake.

00:03:05.533 --> 00:03:09.294
So you know that queasy feeling,
that insecure thing,

00:03:09.294 --> 00:03:13.054
when we feel like we're doing
something wrong?

00:03:13.054 --> 00:03:15.533
That is the trigger
that you need to look for.

00:03:15.533 --> 00:03:21.073
Because that is the signal that tells you
that you're going beyond your database

00:03:21.073 --> 00:03:25.055
and that you're allowing yourself
to explore the realm of the new language.

00:03:25.055 --> 00:03:27.120
Let me show you how
this works in practice.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.148
Let's say, we're going to go
and learn the word "door" in Spanish.

00:03:31.148 --> 00:03:33.336
So, the word "door"
in Spanish is "Puerta."

00:03:33.336 --> 00:03:36.526
So, for "Puerta" we've got
a few sounds that exist in English.

00:03:36.526 --> 00:03:38.760
So, the "Pu," "e," and "ta."

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.257
However, when it comes to the "r,"

00:03:42.257 --> 00:03:45.185
that sound is not in our database.

00:03:45.185 --> 00:03:46.495
The "RR."

00:03:46.495 --> 00:03:52.909
The rolled "r" does not exist
in the English sound database.

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:55.623
And it's a little bit on the outside.

00:03:55.623 --> 00:03:58.293
So, if we allowed ourselves

00:03:58.293 --> 00:04:01.263
to bridge through our database,
and to really break through

00:04:01.263 --> 00:04:02.753
and to make the mistake,

00:04:02.753 --> 00:04:04.888
we could make sounds like the "RR."

00:04:04.888 --> 00:04:06.607
But instead, what sometimes happens

00:04:06.607 --> 00:04:10.410
is that we get the closest relative of it
that is within the database,

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.787
and that is the "ah-er" sound.

00:04:12.787 --> 00:04:14.204
(Laughter)

00:04:14.204 --> 00:04:16.190
And that "ah-er" sound

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.808
makes something
that sounds like "pue-er-rta,"

00:04:18.808 --> 00:04:22.476
which doesn't mean a thing in Spanish,

00:04:22.476 --> 00:04:26.157
and actually doesn't sound too charming.

00:04:26.157 --> 00:04:28.780
And it doesn't tell you too much.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.735
So, for the first technique,

00:04:30.735 --> 00:04:33.464
allow yourself to make that mistake,

00:04:33.464 --> 00:04:36.754
so that sounds like "Puerta" can come out.

00:04:36.754 --> 00:04:38.518
And now let's go to the second one.

00:04:38.518 --> 00:04:39.829
For the second one,

00:04:39.829 --> 00:04:41.925
I'm going to need
some of your collaboration.

00:04:41.925 --> 00:04:45.283
We're going to read
these four beautiful words.

00:04:45.283 --> 00:04:46.822
And on the count of three.

00:04:46.822 --> 00:04:50.489
So let's start with the first one,
on the count of three: one, two, three.

00:04:50.489 --> 00:04:52.235
(Audience) Mao.
SE: "Mao," perfect.

00:04:52.235 --> 00:04:54.608
The second one: one, two, three.
(Audience:) Coco.

00:04:54.608 --> 00:04:56.735
SE: Perfect. Third one.
One, two, three.

00:04:56.735 --> 00:04:58.933
(Audience) Cocao.
SE: Perfect.

00:04:58.933 --> 00:05:01.565
And the fourth one. One, two, three.

00:05:01.565 --> 00:05:03.333
(Silence)

00:05:03.333 --> 00:05:06.280
Oh.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.987
Let me show you what happened
when we did this.

00:05:08.987 --> 00:05:11.296
We get theses four words

00:05:11.296 --> 00:05:14.972
and we put them through
a sort of American English filter.

00:05:14.972 --> 00:05:19.736
And we get something
looks kind of like this.

00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:21.786
And I'll tell you the results of that.

00:05:21.786 --> 00:05:24.119
So for the first one "Mão,"

00:05:24.119 --> 00:05:26.291
which means "hand" in Portuguese,

00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:29.087
we put it through the filter,
we get "Mao."

00:05:29.087 --> 00:05:30.703
(Laughter)

00:05:30.703 --> 00:05:32.811
For the second one we get "coco,"

00:05:32.811 --> 00:05:34.980
which is "coconut" in Portuguese,

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.326
or "cocô," which means "poop."

00:05:38.326 --> 00:05:41.074
We put through the filter,
we get a warm cup of cocoa.

00:05:41.074 --> 00:05:42.522
(Laughter)

00:05:42.522 --> 00:05:44.521
And for the fourth one,

00:05:44.521 --> 00:05:45.865
we have "huo,"

00:05:45.865 --> 00:05:48.419
which means "fire" in Chinese.

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:49.573
And we get --

00:05:49.573 --> 00:05:52.609
if you're feeling really creative,
maybe a dude doing karate...

00:05:52.634 --> 00:05:53.680
(Laughter)

00:05:53.712 --> 00:05:55.582
But anyway,

00:05:55.582 --> 00:05:59.772
these don't tell you much
about how these things are pronounced.

00:05:59.772 --> 00:06:01.688
And if you think it's only one way,

00:06:01.688 --> 00:06:04.482
only if you're going from English
to a different language,

00:06:04.482 --> 00:06:06.207
think about non-native speakers.

00:06:06.207 --> 00:06:07.823
And try to explain to someone

00:06:07.823 --> 00:06:09.862
that this [though] is pronounced "though,"

00:06:09.862 --> 00:06:12.286
and that this [thought]
is pronounced "thought."

00:06:12.286 --> 00:06:14.602
And even though
they look almost identical,

00:06:14.602 --> 00:06:16.997
they have nothing to do with one another.

00:06:16.997 --> 00:06:18.620
Or try to explain to them that

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.080
this [enough] is "enough"

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.489
and this [enuf] is just simply wrong.

00:06:22.489 --> 00:06:29.107
See, there is nothing useful
about using that foreign alphabet,

00:06:29.107 --> 00:06:31.098
when you're trying to learn a language.

00:06:31.098 --> 00:06:34.086
Why? Because it will
give you wrong signals.

00:06:34.086 --> 00:06:36.477
So what is the second technique?

00:06:36.477 --> 00:06:37.880
Scrap it.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.889
Scrap the foreign alphabet.

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:44.859
Let me give you an alternative
of how you can go about this.

00:06:44.859 --> 00:06:46.900
This is a Brazilian currency,

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.541
and it spelled like this.

00:06:48.541 --> 00:06:51.939
On the count of three, can we all say
the name of the currency. 1, 2, 3.

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:53.374
(Audience) Real.

00:06:53.374 --> 00:06:55.997
SE: We have some people
who know the spelling.

00:06:56.057 --> 00:06:58.487
Yeah, "re-al," for the most part.

00:06:58.487 --> 00:07:03.973
And as useful as this might seem,
it doesn't tell you a single thing.

00:07:03.973 --> 00:07:07.445
And when you're speaking Portuguese,
"re-al" means nothing.

00:07:07.445 --> 00:07:08.944
Let me give you an alternative.

00:07:08.944 --> 00:07:13.643
See, in Portuguese,
the way that you say "real" is "heou."

00:07:13.652 --> 00:07:16.726
So let me teach you how to say it.

00:07:16.726 --> 00:07:19.012
So on the count of three, let's say "he."

00:07:19.012 --> 00:07:21.181
So it's "hey" without the "y" sound.

00:07:21.181 --> 00:07:23.312
So, one, two, three -- "he."

00:07:23.312 --> 00:07:25.023
(Audience) HE.
SE: Perfect.

00:07:25.023 --> 00:07:26.456
And now let's say "ou."

00:07:26.456 --> 00:07:28.872
It's like "ouch",
but without the "ch" sound,

00:07:28.872 --> 00:07:30.998
so it's "ou." One, two, three,

00:07:31.008 --> 00:07:32.810
(Audience) OU.
SE: Perfect.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:33.884
So, "HE."

00:07:33.884 --> 00:07:35.183
(Audience) HE.

00:07:35.183 --> 00:07:36.520
SE: "OU."

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.580
(Audience:) OU.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:38.890
SE: "HE."
(Audience:) HE.

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:40.308
SE: "OU."
(Audience:) OU.

00:07:40.308 --> 00:07:43.972
SE: "HE-OU," HEOU.

00:07:43.972 --> 00:07:46.730
(Audience) HE-OU.
SE: Perfect.

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.914
Now you all sound like
passionate Brazilian capitalists.

00:07:49.914 --> 00:07:51.598
(Laughter)

00:07:51.598 --> 00:07:58.202
So why would we go and use
something that looks like this,

00:07:58.202 --> 00:08:00.203
that looks like "real,"

00:08:00.203 --> 00:08:02.035
when instead you can use something

00:08:02.035 --> 00:08:05.152
that looks like this and gives you
so much more information

00:08:05.152 --> 00:08:08.794
about how to say something
in a foreign language.

00:08:08.794 --> 00:08:10.608
And that puts us in a really good spot

00:08:10.608 --> 00:08:12.927
because at this point we allowed ourselves

00:08:12.927 --> 00:08:15.811
to break through our database
and to make mistakes,

00:08:15.811 --> 00:08:19.478
to go into that uncharted territory
of a new language.

00:08:19.478 --> 00:08:22.657
And then, we figured out
how to take notations

00:08:22.657 --> 00:08:25.792
in a way that the information
is actually meaningful.

00:08:25.792 --> 00:08:28.051
But then how can we test it?

00:08:28.051 --> 00:08:31.006
And that's where
technique number 3 comes in.

00:08:31.006 --> 00:08:35.011
Technique number 3
is about finding a stickler.

00:08:35.011 --> 00:08:37.809
So finding someone who's detail-oriented

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:40.520
and won't let you to get away
with the mistakes.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.865
And more than finding someone
who is really that person,

00:08:43.865 --> 00:08:45.665
the guru for the language,

00:08:45.665 --> 00:08:49.702
it's more about establishing
the right sort of relationship.

00:08:49.702 --> 00:08:51.088
Relationship with someone,

00:08:51.088 --> 00:08:54.016
where they'll correct you,
and feel comfortable correcting you

00:08:54.016 --> 00:08:57.869
and making sure that you're getting
to that spot you wanted in a language.

00:08:57.869 --> 00:08:59.434
But at the same time,

00:08:59.434 --> 00:09:00.879
someone who will encourage you

00:09:00.879 --> 00:09:04.146
to get things wrong and to make
those mistakes in the first place.

00:09:04.146 --> 00:09:06.739
And sticklers could be your teacher,

00:09:06.739 --> 00:09:08.482
it could be your tutor, friend,

00:09:08.482 --> 00:09:12.586
it could be someone on Skype
or on Craigslist; it doesn't matter.

00:09:12.586 --> 00:09:14.595
You can find sticklers all over the place,

00:09:14.595 --> 00:09:17.784
and with technology,
it becomes a lot easier find them.

00:09:17.784 --> 00:09:21.045
And then it's time to practice.

00:09:21.045 --> 00:09:24.486
And for practicing,
we've got the fourth technique.

00:09:24.486 --> 00:09:26.422
See, I always thought I had this thing

00:09:26.454 --> 00:09:30.412
that was a little bit
of "Sid craziness" that I did,

00:09:30.412 --> 00:09:32.671
and then I realized how useful it was.

00:09:32.671 --> 00:09:38.735
I always did what I like to call
"Shower Conversations."

00:09:38.735 --> 00:09:42.502
And shower conversations are
exactly what they sound like.

00:09:42.502 --> 00:09:44.253
When I was learning a new language,

00:09:44.253 --> 00:09:46.534
I would stay in the shower
for a few minutes.

00:09:46.534 --> 00:09:48.875
I would remember
having all these discussions;

00:09:48.875 --> 00:09:50.889
I remember when I was learning Chinese,

00:09:50.889 --> 00:09:53.949
and I would haggle
and try to get two yen more,

00:09:53.949 --> 00:09:57.479
to get that wonderful dumpling,
and getting the discount;

00:09:57.479 --> 00:09:59.418
or I would go to Roma

00:09:59.418 --> 00:10:02.887
and I'd ask for directions
to the best "piazza."

00:10:02.887 --> 00:10:04.187
It was amazing.

00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:06.473
The beautiful thing
about the shower conversation

00:10:06.473 --> 00:10:10.879
is that it allows you to find wherever
you have a gap in your knowledge,

00:10:10.879 --> 00:10:14.099
because you're having
a conversation on both ends.

00:10:14.099 --> 00:10:18.242
For example, it's easy to ask
for directions, how about receiving them?

00:10:18.242 --> 00:10:20.415
Or even better, giving directions.

00:10:20.415 --> 00:10:24.510
Well, the shower conversation forces you
to have both side of the conversation.

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:27.204
And you don't need
to have them in the shower.

00:10:27.204 --> 00:10:30.105
Another wonderful thing
is that you can have them anywhere.

00:10:30.105 --> 00:10:32.501
You can have them in the shower,
in your apartment,

00:10:32.501 --> 00:10:35.457
walking down in the streets,
in the subway,

00:10:35.457 --> 00:10:38.003
and seriously, if you're in the subway,

00:10:38.003 --> 00:10:40.661
speaking to yourself in a foreign
language in New York,

00:10:40.661 --> 00:10:42.022
you'll fit right in.

00:10:42.025 --> 00:10:43.662
You're fine.

00:10:43.662 --> 00:10:44.916
It's great,

00:10:44.916 --> 00:10:49.230
because you don't depend on anything
or anyone to get your practice,

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:51.084
and I did this for years.

00:10:51.084 --> 00:10:54.009
And later on I found
that professional athletes do, too.

00:10:54.009 --> 00:10:58.293
Michael Phelps is known to visualize
every single one of his races,

00:10:58.293 --> 00:11:01.487
several times over,
before jumping in water.

00:11:01.487 --> 00:11:02.932
Worked great for him,

00:11:02.932 --> 00:11:04.936
and it works great for me, too,

00:11:04.936 --> 00:11:07.648
so it would work for you as well.

00:11:07.648 --> 00:11:10.961
And now let's go to using the language.

00:11:10.961 --> 00:11:12.681
Because up to now, it's great,

00:11:12.681 --> 00:11:14.831
we've figured out
how to do all these things,

00:11:14.831 --> 00:11:18.303
and that puts us in a really good position
to use the language,

00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:22.477
and for that I recommend
you find a conversation buddy.

00:11:22.477 --> 00:11:24.601
To find a conversation buddy,

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:29.495
I recommend you follow what I call
"The Buddy Formula."

00:11:29.495 --> 00:11:31.942
And that is a way that you can make sure

00:11:31.942 --> 00:11:37.228
that your incentives are always aligned
to use the new language.

00:11:37.228 --> 00:11:38.593
So for that is,

00:11:38.593 --> 00:11:42.918
the target language should be
your best language in common.

00:11:42.918 --> 00:11:44.074
Why?

00:11:44.074 --> 00:11:45.921
If you're anything like me,

00:11:45.921 --> 00:11:47.781
you like to learn languages,

00:11:47.781 --> 00:11:50.721
so that you can communicate
with more people,

00:11:50.721 --> 00:11:52.183
so that you can reach out

00:11:52.183 --> 00:11:56.098
and understand a little bit more
about their brains and hearts.

00:11:56.098 --> 00:11:59.862
And so, if we try to talk to
someone in a foreign language

00:11:59.862 --> 00:12:03.246
that both of us don't do really well,
when we could be speaking English,

00:12:03.246 --> 00:12:06.556
or whatever language you're
more comfortable with as a pair,

00:12:06.556 --> 00:12:10.097
odds are that you're going to revert
to that language that is easier.

00:12:10.097 --> 00:12:13.489
So I recommend you to find someone
where your best language in common

00:12:13.489 --> 00:12:15.311
is your target language.

00:12:15.311 --> 00:12:18.028
And if you can't find one locally,
try technology.

00:12:18.028 --> 00:12:21.475
Or if you can travel,
that would be perfect.

00:12:21.475 --> 00:12:24.007
There's a problem with that,
and I realize it,

00:12:24.007 --> 00:12:27.749
because it's difficult to find someone
who fits that profile exactly.

00:12:27.749 --> 00:12:29.473
But I've got good news.

00:12:29.473 --> 00:12:32.317
And I've found that out when I was work,

00:12:32.317 --> 00:12:34.697
and one of my colleagues,
he's a linguist, too,

00:12:34.697 --> 00:12:37.217
he speaks a ton of languages,

00:12:37.217 --> 00:12:41.349
and our best language in common
was definitely English.

00:12:41.349 --> 00:12:44.928
Our second best language in common:
definitely French.

00:12:44.928 --> 00:12:49.947
But we always spoke in German
to each other in the office.

00:12:49.947 --> 00:12:51.726
Why was that?

00:12:51.726 --> 00:12:54.930
It was because there were people
in the office who spoke English;

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:57.454
there were people in the office
who spoke French.

00:12:57.454 --> 00:13:00.879
But we could talk about Friday
and Saturday night in German,

00:13:00.879 --> 00:13:03.951
and nobody had any idea
what we were talking about.

00:13:03.957 --> 00:13:07.651
So it can also be your best
secret language in common.

00:13:07.651 --> 00:13:09.318
(Laughter)

00:13:09.318 --> 00:13:11.501
And it becomes such a convenient tool.

00:13:11.501 --> 00:13:13.457
You can have it with your friends

00:13:13.457 --> 00:13:16.393
and you get the sense of privacy
in public.

00:13:16.393 --> 00:13:19.459
No matter where you are,
you can have a private conversation.

00:13:19.459 --> 00:13:21.144
So, let's recap.

00:13:21.144 --> 00:13:22.651
With the first technique

00:13:22.651 --> 00:13:26.288
we allow ourselves to break
through the barrier of language

00:13:26.288 --> 00:13:29.216
and to explore the uncharted territory

00:13:29.216 --> 00:13:31.940
of sounds and structures
outside our database.

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.795
Then with the second one,

00:13:33.795 --> 00:13:35.621
we learn how to take notes

00:13:35.621 --> 00:13:37.727
and how to make sure
that we can take notes

00:13:37.727 --> 00:13:41.015
in a way that we can replicate
those sounds and structures later.

00:13:41.015 --> 00:13:44.905
Then we can check the mistakes
by finding a stickler.

00:13:44.905 --> 00:13:46.334
Fourth: Practice.

00:13:46.334 --> 00:13:49.263
Have shower conversations,
wherever you want to be.

00:13:49.263 --> 00:13:51.504
And then, follow the Buddy Formula,

00:13:51.504 --> 00:13:54.684
and you can find somebody
to practice your language with.

00:13:54.684 --> 00:13:56.766
And after that,

00:13:56.766 --> 00:14:00.532
(Italian) we get to
a truly beautiful place,

00:14:00.532 --> 00:14:02.562
(German) where learning languages

00:14:02.562 --> 00:14:06.642
is no longer something stressful,
difficult and boring,

00:14:06.642 --> 00:14:09.800
(Spanish) but rather
a world of possibilities.

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.508
A world, where each of us
has the opportunity to explore

00:14:12.508 --> 00:14:17.326
(French) new cultures and
all the different ways of living.

00:14:17.326 --> 00:14:19.805
(Br. Portuguese)
The greatest reward from this,

00:14:19.805 --> 00:14:23.054
is that we end up learning
more about ourselves.

00:14:23.054 --> 00:14:27.010
(Greek) As of now,
it may all sound Greek for you.

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:31.676
But that doesn't mean
that you can't learn it.

00:14:32.185 --> 00:14:34.514
(Mandarin Chinese)
"A journey of a thousand miles

00:14:34.514 --> 00:14:35.932
begins with the first step."

00:14:35.932 --> 00:14:40.926
(English) And this is not a problem,
because now you know how to walk.

00:14:40.926 --> 00:14:42.270
Thank you.

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:45.059
(Applause)
