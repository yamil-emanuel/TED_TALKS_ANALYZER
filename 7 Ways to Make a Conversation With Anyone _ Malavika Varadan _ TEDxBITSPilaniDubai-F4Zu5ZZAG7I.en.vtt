00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:09.529
Hello, everybody.

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:13.759
I'm going to start with a question.

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:19.469
How many of you know the person
sitting next to you from before today?

00:00:21.648 --> 00:00:22.682
Interesting.

00:00:22.682 --> 00:00:26.988
So, do you remember the first conversation
that you ever had with that person?

00:00:28.374 --> 00:00:31.251
You know conversations are links.

00:00:32.151 --> 00:00:35.551
Let's imagine every conversation
to be a tiny metal link.

00:00:35.551 --> 00:00:38.121
And every time you talk to a stranger,

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:39.781
a metal link is formed.

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:43.741
And every conversation that you have
after that moment,

00:00:43.741 --> 00:00:46.986
the link gets stronger and stronger.

00:00:46.986 --> 00:00:51.882
And every day each one of us
meets so many strangers:

00:00:51.882 --> 00:00:54.441
the grocery guy, the cab guy

00:00:54.441 --> 00:00:57.511
maybe the receptionist
at a new office you went to.

00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:01.311
And with every conversation
we build new links.

00:01:02.361 --> 00:01:04.238
Until finally at the end,

00:01:05.318 --> 00:01:12.082
we've created a kind of massive
World Wide Web of conversation.

00:01:12.922 --> 00:01:14.348
World Wide Web.

00:01:14.348 --> 00:01:17.518
It's a catchy word.
I think I've heard that somewhere.

00:01:19.178 --> 00:01:22.805
That's it, right? A conversation.
It's a fascinating thing.

00:01:22.805 --> 00:01:25.565
A conversation is an adventure.

00:01:25.565 --> 00:01:28.635
A conversation gives you
a whole new perspective.

00:01:28.635 --> 00:01:31.095
A conversation opens a door.

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:36.765
Conversations can make war
and conversations can make peace.

00:01:36.765 --> 00:01:41.865
And conversations define
who we are as a human race.

00:01:43.107 --> 00:01:44.607
Think about this.

00:01:44.607 --> 00:01:48.207
Every single person in your life
was once a stranger to you.

00:01:49.277 --> 00:01:55.387
And you knew nothing about them
until you had that first conversation.

00:01:56.697 --> 00:02:00.227
So I'm here today to tell you
to talk to strangers,

00:02:01.397 --> 00:02:03.218
to have a conversation.

00:02:03.218 --> 00:02:05.934
And I'm here to tell you how.

00:02:05.934 --> 00:02:10.124
Seven ways that you can make
a conversation with almost anyone.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.190
I'm a radio presenter

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.380
and I love talking to people.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.040
I do. I love it.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.110
And I'm so glad that I do it for a living.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.940
Here's what my day is like.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.790
Every single morning,
I go into an empty room,

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.210
I put on a mic,

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.783
and I have a conversation
with 1.6 million people ...

00:02:35.183 --> 00:02:36.513
that I can't see.

00:02:37.943 --> 00:02:39.063
Yeah.

00:02:39.783 --> 00:02:42.143
You know what the hardest part is, though?

00:02:42.143 --> 00:02:43.456
It's time.

00:02:43.456 --> 00:02:47.276
In a four-hour show, I get 20 minutes.

00:02:48.546 --> 00:02:50.386
That's all the talk there is.

00:02:50.386 --> 00:02:54.856
And in 20 minutes I have to convince you
that I am your best friend.

00:02:56.208 --> 00:02:58.188
How do I do that?

00:02:58.188 --> 00:03:01.097
How do I establish a connection?

00:03:01.097 --> 00:03:06.307
I have 20 minutes to inform you,
to excite you, to engage with you

00:03:06.307 --> 00:03:07.837
but most importantly,

00:03:07.837 --> 00:03:10.697
20 out of the 20 times
that I switch on that mic,

00:03:10.697 --> 00:03:13.777
I have to leave a smile on your face.

00:03:15.356 --> 00:03:18.791
Except, I can't see you,
I know nothing about you,

00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:22.491
and I have no way
of gauging your reactions.

00:03:22.491 --> 00:03:25.510
How do you do it?
How do you talk to a stranger?

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.470
Well, my nine years in radio
have taught me these simple little tricks.

00:03:34.206 --> 00:03:35.319
Strangers,

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.789
they are everywhere.

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.399
And we've always been told,
"Don't talk to strangers!"

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:45.159
But I beg to differ.

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:49.409
Every stranger comes with an opportunity,

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:51.709
an opportunity to learn something new,

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.592
an opportunity to have an experience
you've never had

00:03:54.592 --> 00:03:57.532
or hear a story that you've
never heard before.

00:03:59.062 --> 00:04:01.855
And you've had that moment, right?

00:04:01.855 --> 00:04:04.295
You're in the room
with someone you don't know,

00:04:04.295 --> 00:04:08.285
and you look across the room,
you see a stranger, and you think,

00:04:08.285 --> 00:04:10.385
"I want to talk to this person."

00:04:10.385 --> 00:04:14.175
And you can almost hear the first word
but it just won't come out,

00:04:14.175 --> 00:04:16.409
it kind of gets stuck about here,

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:18.659
it kind of goes up and down

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:20.729
and you don't know -

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.089
You know what?

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:24.629
Here's my advice: just say it.

00:04:25.649 --> 00:04:27.245
What's the worst that can happen?

00:04:27.245 --> 00:04:30.590
They want to talk to you.
Well, they're not talking to you now.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.750
The first word floodgates.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.570
I truly believe that the first word
acts as a floodgate.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.171
You know, once you said the first word
everything else just flows.

00:04:41.171 --> 00:04:42.416
So keep it simple.

00:04:42.416 --> 00:04:45.776
A "Hi," a "Hey," a "Hello."

00:04:47.086 --> 00:04:49.286
And do what every good bowler does.

00:04:49.286 --> 00:04:53.721
Just gather the enthusiasm,
the positivity, the energy,

00:04:53.721 --> 00:04:57.211
put on a big smile and say, "Hi!"

00:04:59.095 --> 00:05:02.555
I know. There's going
to be that strange moment right now.

00:05:02.555 --> 00:05:06.065
Turn to someone sitting next to you,
stick your hand out and say hello.

00:05:06.065 --> 00:05:07.115
Go on.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.130
(Laughter)

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.600
I love the awkward laughter.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.800
"Why is she making us do this?"

00:05:16.803 --> 00:05:18.993
The first word floodgates.

00:05:21.386 --> 00:05:24.806
You know, here's a challenge
we face every day.

00:05:24.806 --> 00:05:25.776
Time.

00:05:25.776 --> 00:05:27.656
We have 90 seconds on radio,

00:05:27.656 --> 00:05:31.416
and we have to make that conversation
with a stranger memorable.

00:05:31.416 --> 00:05:32.993
So how do you do it?

00:05:34.023 --> 00:05:36.483
What's the biggest challenge?

00:05:36.483 --> 00:05:37.473
Honestly,

00:05:38.423 --> 00:05:40.763
if we get stuck in the rut of:

00:05:40.763 --> 00:05:42.503
"Hi!" "Hey!"

00:05:42.503 --> 00:05:44.587
"How are you?" "I'm fine."

00:05:44.587 --> 00:05:47.037
"What's going on?" "Nothing much."

00:05:47.037 --> 00:05:49.057
"Same old." "So tell me what's new?"

00:05:49.057 --> 00:05:52.597
There you go, 45 seconds down, wasted.

00:05:52.597 --> 00:05:53.790
Right?

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.020
So, here's my advice:

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.023
skip the small talk
and ask a really personal question.

00:05:59.023 --> 00:06:00.333
And don't be afraid.

00:06:00.333 --> 00:06:01.753
Trust me.

00:06:01.753 --> 00:06:06.793
You will be surprised how much people
are willing to share if you just ask.

00:06:07.929 --> 00:06:10.009
So ask any kind of personal question.

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:12.929
Maybe: Interesting name.

00:06:12.929 --> 00:06:15.831
How did your parents think of it?
Is there a story behind it?

00:06:15.831 --> 00:06:16.831
Or ...

00:06:16.831 --> 00:06:18.671
How long have you lived in this city?

00:06:18.671 --> 00:06:21.531
And do you remember
the first day you landed here?

00:06:23.071 --> 00:06:25.701
Answers to those questions
are always something unique,

00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:27.641
always something personal.

00:06:28.601 --> 00:06:31.621
My favorite one to try is:

00:06:31.621 --> 00:06:34.351
Where do you come from?
And where does your family live?

00:06:34.351 --> 00:06:35.431
Unfailingly,

00:06:35.431 --> 00:06:38.351
every single time
I sit in a cab, I do this.

00:06:38.351 --> 00:06:39.701
I ask that question.

00:06:39.701 --> 00:06:42.381
Where do you come from?
And where does your family live?

00:06:42.381 --> 00:06:43.991
Let me tell you a little story.

00:06:43.991 --> 00:06:46.641
I was coming home one night ...

00:06:46.641 --> 00:06:50.167
I get into this taxi, open the door,
sit down and I say,

00:06:50.167 --> 00:06:52.541
"Where are you from?
Where does your family live?"

00:06:52.541 --> 00:06:55.301
And the 60-year-old Pakistani
cab-driver goes on to tell me

00:06:55.301 --> 00:06:57.571
all about his life in Peshawar.

00:06:57.571 --> 00:06:59.278
We talked about politics,

00:06:59.278 --> 00:07:03.598
we talked about music,
family, wife, his farm.

00:07:04.328 --> 00:07:09.438
And 20 minutes later he is convinced
that I am the perfect bride

00:07:09.438 --> 00:07:12.402
for his 26-year-old
college-educated son from Peshawar.

00:07:12.402 --> 00:07:13.572
(Laughter)

00:07:13.572 --> 00:07:15.250
And as I'm getting out of the taxi,

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:20.326
he is taking out a passport-sized
photograph with this look of enthusiasm.

00:07:20.326 --> 00:07:23.057
I have to say, it was a very
difficult goodbye.

00:07:23.057 --> 00:07:25.082
But the moral of the story, really,

00:07:25.082 --> 00:07:29.482
is what starts with a "Hello"
can end with a marriage proposal.

00:07:29.482 --> 00:07:32.158
And that is a warning.

00:07:32.158 --> 00:07:34.018
(Laughter)

00:07:34.018 --> 00:07:35.038
Step three.

00:07:36.458 --> 00:07:38.548
Find the "me too"s.

00:07:39.308 --> 00:07:40.912
Have you ever met someone

00:07:40.912 --> 00:07:44.118
who starts a conversation
like they're starting a debate?

00:07:44.118 --> 00:07:46.238
"I am from Delhi."
"I hate Delhi."

00:07:46.238 --> 00:07:47.860
(Laughter)

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.733
Yeah? Nothing kills
a conversation like a negative.

00:07:51.733 --> 00:07:53.696
When you meet someone for the first time

00:07:53.696 --> 00:07:55.836
make an effort to find the one thing

00:07:55.836 --> 00:07:59.056
that you and that other person
might have in common.

00:07:59.056 --> 00:08:03.208
When you start at that point
and then move outward from there,

00:08:03.215 --> 00:08:07.904
you will find that all of a sudden
the conversation becomes a lot easier.

00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:13.485
And that's because both of you suddenly
are on the same side of something.

00:08:14.695 --> 00:08:17.744
And that's a really powerful feeling.

00:08:18.394 --> 00:08:23.276
Now, what could you possibly have
in common with a stranger you ask?

00:08:23.276 --> 00:08:24.720
Could be anything, right?

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.934
You're both in the same place
at the same time,

00:08:27.934 --> 00:08:29.894
maybe you're from the same country,

00:08:29.894 --> 00:08:32.314
maybe you both like the winter

00:08:32.314 --> 00:08:34.372
or you're longing for it to rain.

00:08:34.372 --> 00:08:36.612
I don't know, you'd find something.

00:08:37.703 --> 00:08:39.323
When you find a "me too,"

00:08:39.323 --> 00:08:43.750
you automatically have a kind of
buy-in from the other person.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:45.800
Trust me, that's helpful.

00:08:47.368 --> 00:08:49.828
Pay a unique compliment.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:54.260
I read somewhere
that people will forget what you do,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.860
and they'll forget what you say,

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.557
but they will never forget
how you made them feel.

00:08:59.517 --> 00:09:01.488
So be generous.

00:09:01.488 --> 00:09:07.023
And go out and give someone
a nice full compliment.

00:09:08.113 --> 00:09:12.404
So, I have this belief
about a "compliment immunity meter",

00:09:12.404 --> 00:09:14.684
and it comes from this experience I had

00:09:14.684 --> 00:09:17.070
when I met this gorgeous supermodel.

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:18.420
And I look at her and I say,

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.270
"Wow! You are beautiful!"

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:24.090
And there is no reaction on her face.

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:27.403
And I think to myself, "How?"

00:09:27.403 --> 00:09:28.993
That's when I realized,

00:09:28.993 --> 00:09:32.163
she is immune to the word "beautiful."

00:09:32.163 --> 00:09:34.953
She's probably heard it
a hundred thousand times today.

00:09:34.953 --> 00:09:36.934
And if she's on social media,

00:09:36.934 --> 00:09:39.958
she's heard it a million times today.

00:09:40.328 --> 00:09:43.488
There are some words that each of us
have developed an immunity to.

00:09:43.488 --> 00:09:47.367
It could be "nice," it could be "awesome,"
it could be "cool" ...

00:09:47.367 --> 00:09:49.542
Stay away from these.

00:09:49.542 --> 00:09:53.227
Try and construct a compliment
that's unique and genuine,

00:09:53.227 --> 00:09:55.677
and you don't have to lie.

00:09:55.677 --> 00:09:56.876
Really.

00:09:56.876 --> 00:09:58.847
When you look at someone and say,

00:09:58.847 --> 00:10:00.913
"I love how when you smile,

00:10:00.913 --> 00:10:03.973
it's like your nose smiles,
and then your eyes smile,

00:10:03.973 --> 00:10:06.293
and your ears smile,
even your forehead smiles

00:10:06.293 --> 00:10:09.193
and suddenly, the whole person
is just smiling."

00:10:09.473 --> 00:10:10.473
You see,

00:10:10.473 --> 00:10:13.736
I hope that's a compliment
you're not going to forget for a while.

00:10:15.346 --> 00:10:18.546
Pay a unique and genuine compliment.

00:10:20.316 --> 00:10:21.977
Ask for an opinion.

00:10:23.297 --> 00:10:25.757
All of us have opinions; trust me.

00:10:25.757 --> 00:10:27.611
And we all want them to be heard

00:10:27.611 --> 00:10:30.311
and everybody wants validation.

00:10:31.351 --> 00:10:33.252
So go on and ask for an opinion,

00:10:33.252 --> 00:10:37.262
and that's when you
open up a two-way street.

00:10:37.262 --> 00:10:40.062
That is when the real communication begins,

00:10:40.062 --> 00:10:43.382
and you will be surprised
how much you can pick up about a person

00:10:43.382 --> 00:10:47.231
just by asking their opinion
on something pretty generic.

00:10:48.671 --> 00:10:51.661
Here's a mistake that some people make.

00:10:51.661 --> 00:10:55.111
They ask your opinion
about something really difficult.

00:10:55.111 --> 00:10:57.318
It feels almost intimidating.

00:10:57.318 --> 00:11:00.749
Somewhere in a room,
full of very well-informed people,

00:11:00.749 --> 00:11:03.126
and someone was to come up to me and say,

00:11:03.126 --> 00:11:05.576
"So what do you think about the way

00:11:05.576 --> 00:11:09.935
the oil prices have affected
the real estate market in Dubai?"

00:11:11.835 --> 00:11:12.975
I feel a bit cornered.

00:11:12.975 --> 00:11:15.465
I feel like I might fail,
and this is an examination,

00:11:15.465 --> 00:11:16.685
and that's the lesson.

00:11:16.685 --> 00:11:20.215
Nobody needs to fail
at a first-time conversation.

00:11:21.285 --> 00:11:23.746
Just ask something simple.
Keep it generic.

00:11:23.746 --> 00:11:25.106
How do you like your coffee?

00:11:25.106 --> 00:11:28.026
When did you watch your last movie?
What did you think of it?

00:11:28.026 --> 00:11:30.646
And when somebody gives you their opinion:

00:11:30.646 --> 00:11:32.583
really listen.

00:11:33.443 --> 00:11:36.503
Don't listen to reply. Listen to listen.

00:11:36.503 --> 00:11:37.763
There's a difference.

00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:40.902
And that brings me to my next point.

00:11:42.062 --> 00:11:43.262
Be present.

00:11:44.812 --> 00:11:46.342
I know you've been through this.

00:11:46.342 --> 00:11:47.362
I know I have.

00:11:47.362 --> 00:11:49.522
You're pouring your heart out to someone,

00:11:49.522 --> 00:11:50.622
and they are like this,

00:11:50.622 --> 00:11:52.762
"Yeah, yeah, go on, keep talking.

00:11:53.192 --> 00:11:54.842
I can multitask!

00:11:55.252 --> 00:11:56.812
What's with Wi-Fi?"

00:11:57.092 --> 00:11:58.862
(Laughter)

00:11:59.182 --> 00:12:01.804
You know, when someone's trying
to communicate with you,

00:12:01.804 --> 00:12:04.624
the least you can do
is really be in that conversation.

00:12:04.624 --> 00:12:06.884
Just be wholeheartedly present,

00:12:06.884 --> 00:12:09.164
just be there.

00:12:09.884 --> 00:12:13.780
And - oh! - my favorite part:
make eye contact.

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:18.350
Trust me, eye contact
is where all the magic happens.

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:21.240
You can feel the conversation.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.030
And trust me, when you
are looking at someone in the eye,

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:28.940
nine out of ten times,
they will not dare look away, right?

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:30.380
(Laughter)

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:34.307
Now, if only I could look
into the eyes of 1.6 million people,

00:12:34.307 --> 00:12:39.504
I would not have to worry about you guys
tuning out during the ad breaks.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:46.850
That brings me to this, my favorite point
because I think it's got a catchy name.

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.100
Name, place, animal, thing.

00:12:50.179 --> 00:12:51.829
You remember that game?

00:12:52.709 --> 00:12:55.156
Remember the little details
about a person.

00:12:55.156 --> 00:12:57.886
Remember their name.
It's so important.

00:12:57.886 --> 00:13:01.266
It's awful when you meet someone
for 18th time, and you say,

00:13:01.266 --> 00:13:06.761
"You must be Paul, no Peter.
Something with the P and it ends with ..."

00:13:08.761 --> 00:13:12.231
It's terrible. Remember someone's name
and say it back to them.

00:13:13.141 --> 00:13:16.178
You have no idea how important
you're making them feel,

00:13:16.178 --> 00:13:17.757
and that's not the only detail.

00:13:17.757 --> 00:13:19.737
Remember all the other details as well.

00:13:19.737 --> 00:13:23.287
The places they like to go to,
the places they've been to,

00:13:23.287 --> 00:13:26.837
the places they want to go to,
their pet's names.

00:13:26.837 --> 00:13:30.473
How their pet's been feeling lately?
The things they like.

00:13:30.473 --> 00:13:33.477
Remember their children's names,
that's such a winner.

00:13:33.477 --> 00:13:36.027
Remember their wife's names,
their girlfriend's names.

00:13:36.027 --> 00:13:39.077
Just don't mix up the last two
because that could be disastrous.

00:13:39.077 --> 00:13:41.277
(Laughter)

00:13:41.277 --> 00:13:44.659
Remember these little things about people
and repeat it back to them,

00:13:44.659 --> 00:13:47.269
ask be genuinely interested,

00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:51.249
and automatically you kind of
become an investor in their well-being,

00:13:51.249 --> 00:13:55.509
so they'll feel responsible to you
to keep that conversation going.

00:13:56.989 --> 00:13:58.189
There we go.

00:13:58.189 --> 00:14:02.009
Seven amazing ways that you can
make conversation with anyone,

00:14:02.009 --> 00:14:04.839
and seven reasons
why you should use the break

00:14:04.839 --> 00:14:08.649
that's going to come up to talk
to a stranger that you don't know.

00:14:09.759 --> 00:14:12.752
I'm going to end with this analogy.

00:14:14.402 --> 00:14:17.582
A conversation is like reading a book.

00:14:17.582 --> 00:14:19.772
You can turn to any page you want.

00:14:20.872 --> 00:14:23.282
You can flip to your favorite chapter.

00:14:24.292 --> 00:14:28.430
You can read as long as you want,
and you can read what you want,

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:32.290
and every person, trust me,
is a really good book.

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:36.059
And it saddens me so much

00:14:36.059 --> 00:14:39.179
that entire human lives
are being boiled down

00:14:39.179 --> 00:14:43.239
to 140 characters and catchy headlines.

00:14:43.239 --> 00:14:46.009
Because that's not what we are.

00:14:46.009 --> 00:14:48.559
We are not abridged versions.

00:14:49.789 --> 00:14:51.789
We are entire human stories.

00:14:51.789 --> 00:14:54.059
We deserve more from each other.

00:14:54.059 --> 00:14:58.199
So what are you going to do
in this big world we call the library?

00:14:59.049 --> 00:15:01.244
Are you going to walk around,

00:15:01.244 --> 00:15:04.724
look at the hard bound copies
and read the titles?

00:15:05.914 --> 00:15:09.734
Or are you going to actually
reach for a book,

00:15:10.804 --> 00:15:14.154
open a page and start reading a story?

00:15:16.234 --> 00:15:17.484
You decide.

00:15:17.484 --> 00:15:18.491
Thank you.

00:15:18.491 --> 00:15:21.501
(Applause)
