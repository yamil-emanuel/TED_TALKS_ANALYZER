00:00:10.737 --> 00:00:14.617
I'm fortunate to come from a family
inclined towards the arts.

00:00:14.617 --> 00:00:16.667
I'll give you a few examples.

00:00:19.237 --> 00:00:21.587
My great grandfather
was an Eastern music scholar,

00:00:21.587 --> 00:00:23.547
as well as a multi-instrumentalist.

00:00:23.547 --> 00:00:25.777
He played many instruments,

00:00:25.777 --> 00:00:28.997
like the violin, the sarangi,
and even the harmonium.

00:00:28.997 --> 00:00:33.557
My grandmother chose to follow
in her father's footsteps,

00:00:33.557 --> 00:00:38.037
and became an Eastern classical musician,
as well as a stage performer.

00:00:38.037 --> 00:00:40.447
That's her dressed as a man.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.530
Her brother, my great uncle,

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.830
he is one of Pakistan's
last remaining orators

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.300
and his wife is one of the country's
leading Kathak dancers.

00:00:53.058 --> 00:00:56.568
My parents recognized
my musical aptitude at an early age,

00:00:56.568 --> 00:01:00.528
and had me classically trained in piano
since the age of six.

00:01:00.528 --> 00:01:04.208
This is a short passage
of one of my pieces.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.010
(Piano music starts)

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:20.725
(Piano music ends)

00:01:20.725 --> 00:01:22.035
(Applause)

00:01:22.035 --> 00:01:23.155
Thank you.

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.869
As I got older, I wanted
to branch out an experiment

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.239
and try different things,

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:32.789
and this is when I felt extremely limited
back home, in Pakistan,

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:35.549
because as it is,
teachers are so difficult to come by,

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.789
and those that aren't, they are only focus

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.029
on either Western classical music
or Eastern classical music.

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:43.279
There was nobody who could guide me

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:45.289
and help me to do all the wonderful things

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.919
that I saw artists doing
on sites like YouTube.

00:01:50.272 --> 00:01:53.782
So, I had no choice but to let
the Internet itself be my teacher.

00:01:53.782 --> 00:01:56.552
I would watch hundreds of videos online.

00:01:56.552 --> 00:01:59.872
I would close my eyes and listen 
to the audio over and over again,

00:01:59.872 --> 00:02:01.282
and decipher each note.

00:02:01.282 --> 00:02:04.252
Either that or I'd have to pause
the clip at precise moments

00:02:04.252 --> 00:02:06.072
to examine finger positions.

00:02:06.072 --> 00:02:07.302
This is how I learned.

00:02:07.302 --> 00:02:10.462
I'll show you one of the first things
that I learned when I was 16,

00:02:10.462 --> 00:02:12.042
when I first picked up the guitar.

00:02:12.592 --> 00:02:14.622
(Guitar music in YouTube video starts)

00:02:37.146 --> 00:02:39.006
(Guitar music in YouTube video ends)

00:02:39.176 --> 00:02:40.686
(Guitar music starts)

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.260
(Guitar music ends)

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.300
Alright.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.650
(Applause)

00:03:15.045 --> 00:03:17.325
That was one of the first things
that I learned.

00:03:17.325 --> 00:03:18.385
As time went by,

00:03:18.385 --> 00:03:21.075
it became easier for me
to pick up things from the Internet.

00:03:21.075 --> 00:03:25.515
So I started doing exactly that,
learning from the Internet.

00:03:25.515 --> 00:03:28.305
And why just stop there?
Why limit myself?

00:03:28.305 --> 00:03:30.365
Why not use
all this instrumental knowledge

00:03:30.365 --> 00:03:31.485
that I'm acquiring

00:03:31.485 --> 00:03:33.295
to write my own music?

00:03:33.295 --> 00:03:35.025
Why not write orchestra pieces,

00:03:35.025 --> 00:03:39.035
and even make paintings regarding
and related to those orchestra pieces?

00:03:39.035 --> 00:03:40.265
Something like this.

00:03:40.747 --> 00:03:42.227
(Music starts)

00:04:02.461 --> 00:04:04.301
(Music ends)

00:04:04.301 --> 00:04:07.551
Why not use the Internet
to learn something a bit more obscure,

00:04:07.551 --> 00:04:09.281
like body percussion?

00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:25.749
And why not use the Internet

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:27.279
(Applause)

00:04:29.274 --> 00:04:31.524
to do exactly what I wanted to
in the beginning,

00:04:31.524 --> 00:04:33.474
which was to play different instruments,

00:04:33.474 --> 00:04:36.464
like maybe the mandolin, or the harmonica.

00:04:36.644 --> 00:04:38.594
(Harmonica music starts)

00:04:53.737 --> 00:04:54.987
(Harmonica music ends)

00:04:55.017 --> 00:04:56.707
(Applause)

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.020
It doesn't need to stop there.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:06.030
Why not learn to combine all these things
into a film that I could direct?

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.710
(Film starts) (Music)

00:05:59.101 --> 00:06:00.371
(Film ends)

00:06:00.491 --> 00:06:02.261
(Applause)

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.200
Thank you.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.551
This way of acquiring knowledge
and sharing ideas

00:06:07.551 --> 00:06:09.521
can lead to so many wonderful things,

00:06:09.521 --> 00:06:12.041
like being selected to be a TED Fellow,

00:06:12.041 --> 00:06:15.181
and performing alongside the man
whose videos I used to watch

00:06:15.181 --> 00:06:16.501
and be inspired by

00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:18.791
when I first picked up 
the guitar, Preston Reed.

00:06:18.791 --> 00:06:21.081
When I spoke on the TED main stage,

00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:24.031
it was a wonderful experience
to play with him at TED Global;

00:06:24.031 --> 00:06:25.751
it was like a dream come true.

00:06:25.751 --> 00:06:30.781
It could also lead to being selected
to be one of 32 musicians

00:06:30.781 --> 00:06:33.611
specifically selected
by the U.S. State Department

00:06:33.611 --> 00:06:37.041
to be part of a cultural
and musical exchange tour

00:06:37.041 --> 00:06:39.511
in a program that happened
in the United States,

00:06:39.511 --> 00:06:42.141
just a few months ago,
a few weeks ago actually, sorry.

00:06:42.141 --> 00:06:44.121
I got back from it a few weeks ago.

00:06:44.121 --> 00:06:46.701
It was wonderful
to be part of something like that,

00:06:46.701 --> 00:06:50.541
to see musicians from all over the world
come together and work together.

00:06:51.441 --> 00:06:53.061
It was an incredible experience.

00:06:53.061 --> 00:06:55.511
I'll just end with the composition

00:06:55.511 --> 00:07:00.571
that I wrote for guitar
at the age of 18, I think.

00:07:00.571 --> 00:07:02.291
I just want to say that we have

00:07:02.291 --> 00:07:06.331
so much information and knowledge
available to us, at our fingertips.

00:07:06.331 --> 00:07:08.801
Just imagine what we can do
if we decide to use it.

00:07:08.851 --> 00:07:10.201
(Guitar music starts)

00:10:52.486 --> 00:10:53.726
(Guitar music ends)

00:10:53.916 --> 00:10:56.286
(Applause) (Cheers)

00:10:56.351 --> 00:10:57.661
Thanks.

00:11:00.886 --> 00:11:02.166
Thank you.

00:11:02.166 --> 00:11:03.576
(Applause)
