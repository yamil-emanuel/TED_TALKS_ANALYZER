00:00:02.626 --> 00:00:06.112
Today, I'm going to be talking about
a theory you've never heard of,

00:00:06.112 --> 00:00:09.607
and hopefully by the end of it,
you'll think, as I do,

00:00:09.607 --> 00:00:12.607
that it really is something
that nobody talks about,

00:00:12.607 --> 00:00:16.107
and yet it has changed the world
and continues to change the world.

00:00:17.507 --> 00:00:19.811
It's called the Hamitic hypothesis.

00:00:20.261 --> 00:00:24.161
It's an idea that developed
over hundreds of years,

00:00:24.161 --> 00:00:26.714
became very popular in the 19th century,

00:00:26.714 --> 00:00:30.482
but continues to affect parts
of the world today, particularly Africa.

00:00:31.472 --> 00:00:33.773
It's the subject of a book
that I've written,

00:00:33.773 --> 00:00:35.913
that will be coming out
in a couple of months,

00:00:35.913 --> 00:00:37.331
called The Lost White Tribe:

00:00:37.331 --> 00:00:41.391
Explorers, Scientists,
and the Theory that Changed a Continent.

00:00:41.651 --> 00:00:42.721
This story -

00:00:43.671 --> 00:00:46.291
Well, I should tell you,
I'm a historian of exploration,

00:00:46.291 --> 00:00:47.550
and that's my job.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.922
I look at explorers, expeditions,

00:00:49.922 --> 00:00:54.196
and cultural encounters
with people around the world,

00:00:54.196 --> 00:00:58.003
and why people think these expeditions
are so important, back home.

00:00:58.345 --> 00:01:01.985
And this story of the lost white tribe,
which I'm going to be talking about,

00:01:01.985 --> 00:01:03.309
and the Hamitic hypothesis,

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.309
really grew out of a book
I wrote about ten years ago

00:01:06.309 --> 00:01:10.849
called The Coldest Crucible,
and that was about Arctic exploration.

00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:15.370
And in a way, I never would have imagined
that this book about the Arctic

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.994
would have led me to the project
I'm working on now,

00:01:18.994 --> 00:01:20.872
because this book is about the Arctic,

00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:23.502
and the Hamitic hypothesis
is really about Africa,

00:01:24.092 --> 00:01:27.492
but it actually grew out of part
of that earlier topic.

00:01:28.107 --> 00:01:30.111
I was writing about Arctic exploration.

00:01:30.111 --> 00:01:33.526
I was particularly interested
in American explorers,

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:35.716
and how in the 1800's,

00:01:35.716 --> 00:01:38.856
American explorers found it
so interesting to go to the Arctic,

00:01:38.856 --> 00:01:40.446
a really dangerous place.

00:01:40.446 --> 00:01:43.236
Many dozens of Americans
lost their lives going there,

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:47.556
either to try to find a Northwest Passage
or to get to the North pole.

00:01:48.276 --> 00:01:52.613
But I found this story of one explorer,
his name was Vilhjalmur Stefansson,

00:01:52.613 --> 00:01:54.297
and he went to the Arctic,

00:01:54.297 --> 00:01:58.447
not to try to get to the North pole,
but to find undiscovered peoples.

00:01:58.447 --> 00:02:02.807
While he was in the upper region of Canada

00:02:02.807 --> 00:02:04.787
in a place called Victoria Island,

00:02:04.787 --> 00:02:09.337
he discovered a group of Inuit,
which he described when he came back

00:02:09.337 --> 00:02:13.907
as being blond, of being
what he called blond Eskimos.

00:02:15.107 --> 00:02:19.305
I thought this was the most bizarre story,
but I could not stop reading about it.

00:02:19.675 --> 00:02:22.014
There were stories
all over the US at the time.

00:02:22.014 --> 00:02:24.575
In fact, the worldwide press
took up the story

00:02:24.575 --> 00:02:26.795
of the Blonde Eskimos of Victoria Island.

00:02:26.795 --> 00:02:28.845
Some people thought
it was a complete fake,

00:02:28.845 --> 00:02:29.955
that it was a hoax.

00:02:29.955 --> 00:02:31.441
Other people thought

00:02:31.441 --> 00:02:36.301
it was an amazing kind of discovery
that needed to be explained.

00:02:36.911 --> 00:02:39.001
But I had nothing that I could do with it,

00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:41.541
it had no part to play
in the story I was telling.

00:02:41.541 --> 00:02:43.579
So I tucked it away in a file,

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:47.189
and what I found was
that over the next six years or so,

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:49.789
I started finding more and more

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:54.549
kind of stories of these white tribes

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.289
that people had discovered
all over the world.

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:59.704
So for example, in Panama,

00:02:59.704 --> 00:03:03.374
Richard Marsh finds a group
that he calls the white Indians.

00:03:04.224 --> 00:03:05.804
In Central Asia,

00:03:05.804 --> 00:03:10.224
there is a group of people who said
they found Tibetans who looked Aryan.

00:03:11.114 --> 00:03:14.910
In parts of Africa, people
were finding white tribes as well.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.419
And in Japan, people discovered
in the late 19th century,

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:22.307
a group called the Ainu
in the northern island of Japan,

00:03:22.307 --> 00:03:25.177
which they said looked like Caucasians.

00:03:25.177 --> 00:03:27.619
So, by the time I got to about 2008,

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:31.779
I had this giant file of kind of weird
white tribe discoveries,

00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:35.459
and I figured now is the time
to do something with it.

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.740
But there was one story in particular
that I was interested in,

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.199
and that was the story of a discovery

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:45.189
that took place
in East Africa in the 1870s -

00:03:46.438 --> 00:03:48.628
in that red box you see there.

00:03:48.628 --> 00:03:52.528
It happened just to the west
of Lake Victoria,

00:03:52.528 --> 00:03:54.558
one of the largest lakes in the world,

00:03:54.558 --> 00:03:58.552
and it was made by a very
famous explorer, Henry Morton Stanley.

00:03:58.552 --> 00:04:04.702
Now, Stanley may have been familiar to you
as the guy who discovers Livingstone,

00:04:04.702 --> 00:04:09.887
or rescues Livingstone,
in the heart of Africa in 1869.

00:04:09.887 --> 00:04:12.950
In fact, the phrase
"Dr. Livingstone, I presume?"

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.974
was supposedly something that Stanley
said to Livingstone when they met.

00:04:17.974 --> 00:04:21.410
This was one of the most famous
expeditions of the 19th century.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.150
But, Stanley went back to Africa
and went back many times,

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.812
and on his subsequent
expedition to Africa,

00:04:27.812 --> 00:04:30.022
he went not to find Livingstone,

00:04:30.022 --> 00:04:32.842
but to try to discover
the source of the Nile.

00:04:33.935 --> 00:04:36.008
People knew by the late 1800s

00:04:36.008 --> 00:04:40.368
that there were many lakes
in the areas of East Africa,

00:04:40.368 --> 00:04:43.159
what we call the Rift Valley
of East Africa,

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:46.309
and that one of these lakes
would have been the source of the Nile,

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:50.773
something that geographers
had been searching for, for 2,000 years.

00:04:50.773 --> 00:04:54.533
But Stanley said, "I'm going to figure out
which of these lakes it actually is."

00:04:54.533 --> 00:04:58.194
So he treks into East Africa,
and he determines with great confidence

00:04:58.194 --> 00:05:02.684
that Lake Victoria
is the ultimate source of the Nile,

00:05:02.684 --> 00:05:06.152
4,000 miles of Nile River,
and that is the source.

00:05:06.772 --> 00:05:10.722
But what he also discovers is something
that in a sense creates a new mystery,

00:05:10.722 --> 00:05:15.438
which is he finds that there are
members of an African soldier force

00:05:15.438 --> 00:05:18.728
that are protecting him, which look white,

00:05:18.728 --> 00:05:21.400
and he calls them
"Greeks in white shirts."

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.710
He can't believe how
light complected these Africans are.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.770
He asks other members
of his expedition party,

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:29.952
"Who are these men?"

00:05:29.952 --> 00:05:32.802
and they say, "They come
from the mountains to the West

00:05:32.802 --> 00:05:35.562
on a mountain called Gambaragara."

00:05:35.562 --> 00:05:39.051
So he writes about this
and sends these reports back home,

00:05:39.051 --> 00:05:42.960
and the illustrations of his narrative
actually show Mount Gambaragara

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.260
over on the left-hand side
of the illustration,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.490
you can see it in the background.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.610
This became a huge story, back home,

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.725
this lost white race that Stanley
had found in the heart of Africa.

00:05:53.725 --> 00:05:55.565
How in God's name

00:05:55.565 --> 00:05:59.697
would Stanley have explained this
in the late 18th century?

00:05:59.697 --> 00:06:04.247
What kind of theoretical background
could people use or information?

00:06:04.247 --> 00:06:07.709
Why you would find a group of white people
living in the heart of Africa?

00:06:07.709 --> 00:06:11.905
In fact, Stanley,
very much as a man of the 1800s,

00:06:12.515 --> 00:06:14.266
was at this transition moment

00:06:14.266 --> 00:06:18.076
between people who use the Bible as a way
of explaining the history of the world

00:06:18.426 --> 00:06:21.986
and people who use science as a way
of explaining the history of the world.

00:06:21.986 --> 00:06:23.706
So when Stanley thought about it,

00:06:23.706 --> 00:06:25.723
he actually looked back
to the Middle Ages,

00:06:25.723 --> 00:06:28.444
when people tried
to explain the differences

00:06:28.444 --> 00:06:32.541
that we saw in the peoples of the world,
what we would call racial differences,

00:06:33.461 --> 00:06:37.816
and look to the stories of Genesis,
in particular the story of Noah.

00:06:37.816 --> 00:06:40.775
And in the story of Noah,
we all know about Noah and the flood,

00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:43.627
but a lot of people don't know
what happened after the flood,

00:06:43.627 --> 00:06:48.364
which was Noah parks the Arch
on the top of Mount Ararat,

00:06:48.364 --> 00:06:52.217
disembarks with his family
as well as his three sons,

00:06:53.087 --> 00:06:55.119
Sem, Japheth, and Ham.

00:06:55.119 --> 00:06:59.079
And it was really these three sons
that many people in the Middle Ages -

00:06:59.079 --> 00:07:02.524
by that, we're talking about
Jews, Christians, and Muslims -

00:07:02.524 --> 00:07:05.236
all look to this story
as a kind of explanation

00:07:05.236 --> 00:07:10.566
for how the world got repopulated
after it was annihilated in Genesis 9.

00:07:10.866 --> 00:07:12.026
And as you see here,

00:07:12.026 --> 00:07:15.212
this is a medieval map
showing the three sons of Noah

00:07:15.212 --> 00:07:17.502
on the three known
continents of the world.

00:07:17.502 --> 00:07:20.572
Asia, on the top - you see
the little arch there at the very top,

00:07:20.572 --> 00:07:22.752
hanging out on the top of Ararat.

00:07:23.212 --> 00:07:27.442
And Sem, the base of the word Semitic
comes from Sem, Noah's son.

00:07:27.442 --> 00:07:29.658
And then in the bottom
left corner is Europe -

00:07:29.658 --> 00:07:32.088
this map is rotated east, by the way.

00:07:32.088 --> 00:07:36.608
On the bottom left, you see,
Europe, and that's Japheth.

00:07:36.608 --> 00:07:39.934
And then the forerunner
of all Africans, people thought,

00:07:39.934 --> 00:07:42.704
were the descendants of Ham.

00:07:42.704 --> 00:07:46.121
So when Stanley talks
about this white tribe, he says,

00:07:46.121 --> 00:07:52.051
"Somehow they must
be related to the tribe of Ham,"

00:07:52.051 --> 00:07:54.298
and they became known as Hamites.

00:07:54.298 --> 00:07:56.538
But this was a transition point.

00:07:56.538 --> 00:07:58.437
And Stanley was a very smart man;

00:07:58.437 --> 00:08:02.307
he was also not just reading his Bible,
he was also reading Darwin,

00:08:02.307 --> 00:08:06.487
and he was reading Charles Lyell,
who were beginning to, in a sense,

00:08:06.487 --> 00:08:09.733
dismantle a kind of
biblical history of the world.

00:08:10.513 --> 00:08:12.403
Guys like Darwin and Lyell said,

00:08:12.403 --> 00:08:16.643
"The world was not 6,000 years old;
it's hundreds of thousands of years old" -

00:08:16.643 --> 00:08:19.401
they had no idea how old it really was.

00:08:19.401 --> 00:08:22.501
But it was very, very old,
and in addition to that,

00:08:22.501 --> 00:08:27.284
species maybe didn't stay fixed over time,
maybe species changed over time,

00:08:27.284 --> 00:08:32.038
maybe in fact, human beings
were once resembled something else.

00:08:32.038 --> 00:08:36.384
So Stanley began
to try to adopt these old ideas

00:08:36.384 --> 00:08:39.114
and graph them to new ideas.

00:08:39.114 --> 00:08:41.565
And a lot of other people
at that time did as well.

00:08:41.565 --> 00:08:44.718
Strangely enough, the Hamitic hypothesis,

00:08:44.718 --> 00:08:48.938
this idea that all Africans
came from the descendants of Ham,

00:08:48.938 --> 00:08:50.278
that son of Noah,

00:08:50.278 --> 00:08:55.457
somehow got weirdly flipped
to "No, Hamites are not all Africans,

00:08:55.457 --> 00:09:00.372
Hamites are some invasion of white people
that happened in the ancient past,

00:09:00.372 --> 00:09:02.362
and that this invasion of white people

00:09:02.362 --> 00:09:06.362
explains why we are finding
white tribes all over the world."

00:09:06.362 --> 00:09:09.645
Now, if this sounds a little bizarre,
let me kind of reinforce.

00:09:09.645 --> 00:09:12.115
This was not some wacky idea, like,

00:09:12.115 --> 00:09:15.145
you know, scientists
who go looking for Sasquatch

00:09:15.145 --> 00:09:17.865
or people trying to prove ColdFusion.

00:09:17.865 --> 00:09:22.034
This was anthropologists,
linguists, paleontologists,

00:09:23.524 --> 00:09:26.374
all kinds of scientists
from across the spectrum

00:09:26.374 --> 00:09:27.556
were interested in this.

00:09:27.556 --> 00:09:29.106
This is a map, for example,

00:09:29.106 --> 00:09:31.576
of an anthropologists
named Griffith Taylor,

00:09:31.576 --> 00:09:33.875
who is actually trying
to describe what he saw

00:09:33.875 --> 00:09:38.355
as the racial dispersion of groups
out of Asia around the world.

00:09:38.355 --> 00:09:41.088
Now you look, and it kind of
looks like a swirling map,

00:09:41.088 --> 00:09:44.748
but just to orient you here,
the middle of the map is Asia.

00:09:44.748 --> 00:09:46.008
And as you see,

00:09:46.008 --> 00:09:52.308
there are these kind of initial flows
outward of darker races.

00:09:52.308 --> 00:09:54.051
Now, Griffith Taylor believed

00:09:54.051 --> 00:09:58.184
that the first races
of the human species were primitive,

00:09:58.184 --> 00:10:02.651
and that the later races
of the species were more advanced.

00:10:02.651 --> 00:10:05.877
And like most 19th century Europeans
and North Americans,

00:10:05.877 --> 00:10:08.190
when they thought
about primitive and advanced,

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.630
they saw it also as a racial ladder,

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:14.851
and that primitive meant dark skinned
and advanced meant light skinned.

00:10:14.851 --> 00:10:18.450
So they created a kind of
color map of the world:

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:23.520
to give you another example,
he called this the Lava Flow analogy,

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:28.590
that all of the races of the human species
emerged first in Asia,

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:29.926
and then gradually,

00:10:29.926 --> 00:10:33.306
the later, more advanced, races -
i.e. the white race -

00:10:33.306 --> 00:10:37.096
kind of rolled over the other races
and spread itself out

00:10:37.096 --> 00:10:41.306
as it conquered and overcame
and drove to the edges

00:10:41.306 --> 00:10:43.869
the darker raced peoples of the world,

00:10:43.869 --> 00:10:47.251
either intermarrying with them
or conquering them.

00:10:47.251 --> 00:10:50.663
So this was the idea
that could somehow explain

00:10:50.663 --> 00:10:55.353
why you would find
white tribes in weird areas.

00:10:55.353 --> 00:10:57.664
It also happened to fit very nicely

00:10:57.664 --> 00:11:00.644
with what was happening
in the late 19th century,

00:11:00.644 --> 00:11:04.984
which was new white tribes were taking
over other places in the world.

00:11:04.984 --> 00:11:10.072
Europeans were madly scrambling
for colonial possessions

00:11:10.072 --> 00:11:11.522
from Asia to Africa.

00:11:11.522 --> 00:11:14.665
In fact, this map of Africa
from the late 19th century

00:11:14.665 --> 00:11:17.562
shows, essentially, the color codes here

00:11:17.562 --> 00:11:20.182
are different color codes
for European countries:

00:11:20.182 --> 00:11:26.623
brown is France, green is Great Britain,
blue is Belgium, and purple is Germany.

00:11:26.623 --> 00:11:31.514
Literally, all of Africa had been
carved up by European countries

00:11:31.514 --> 00:11:33.514
as they tried to grab colonies.

00:11:33.514 --> 00:11:38.171
So, the idea that there had been
white ancestors who had done this before

00:11:38.171 --> 00:11:42.236
kind of fit the mode
of European thinking at the time,

00:11:42.236 --> 00:11:45.956
and as European colonists
came into these parts of Africa,

00:11:45.956 --> 00:11:49.600
and they looked at various
groups of Africans, they said,

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.730
"These are the Hamites;
these are the proto-white people.

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:54.410
Let's treat them slightly different

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:58.210
than these people that we think of
as being black African."

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:01.081
So, over the course
of the late 19th century,

00:12:01.081 --> 00:12:05.589
some groups, like the Bahima,
the Batusi of Rwanda,

00:12:06.899 --> 00:12:10.979
the Nyamwezi of Tanzania
were called white,

00:12:10.979 --> 00:12:14.069
and other groups were called,
like the Bahutu of Rwanda,

00:12:14.069 --> 00:12:15.939
were called black.

00:12:15.939 --> 00:12:18.170
Now, at the time,

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:24.689
Africans themselves did not have
the same idea of racial concept, right?

00:12:25.029 --> 00:12:28.772
They thought mostly
in terms of ethnic or clan terms,

00:12:28.772 --> 00:12:31.133
and yet, these ideas caught on.

00:12:31.133 --> 00:12:33.863
And it also allowed Europeans
and North Americans,

00:12:33.863 --> 00:12:38.073
when they looked at the great kind of
legacy of African civilizations,

00:12:38.073 --> 00:12:41.694
when they looked, for example,
at Great Zimbabwe or the great Pyramids,

00:12:41.694 --> 00:12:45.804
they said, "Clearly, black cultures
couldn't have created these.

00:12:45.804 --> 00:12:48.144
These must have been the Hamites, right?

00:12:48.144 --> 00:12:52.044
Those ancient,
highly advanced white invaders

00:12:52.044 --> 00:12:54.474
who were here thousands of years ago.

00:12:54.474 --> 00:12:56.673
So this Hamitic hypothesis

00:12:56.673 --> 00:13:01.223
became a way of explaining,
justifying, white colonization,

00:13:01.223 --> 00:13:04.963
as well as all of this cool stuff
that you find in Africa,

00:13:04.963 --> 00:13:09.293
and that was essentially taken away
from Africans themselves.

00:13:10.333 --> 00:13:13.834
There is a very dark side
to the Hamitic hypothesis as well,

00:13:13.834 --> 00:13:15.037
which is this:

00:13:15.037 --> 00:13:19.267
even after Europeans
left Africa in the 1960s

00:13:19.267 --> 00:13:21.747
and these countries became independent,

00:13:21.747 --> 00:13:24.125
even after the Hamitic hypothesis

00:13:24.125 --> 00:13:27.065
essentially was exploded
as not being true,

00:13:28.015 --> 00:13:29.435
even after that time

00:13:29.435 --> 00:13:35.025
Africans themselves had started
to adapt and adopt the Hamitic hypothesis

00:13:35.025 --> 00:13:36.705
as a part of their own history.

00:13:36.705 --> 00:13:40.415
So for example, the Batusi of Rwanda

00:13:40.415 --> 00:13:44.165
considered themselves
as having an origin outside of Africa,

00:13:44.165 --> 00:13:46.745
and other groups in Africa as well.

00:13:47.455 --> 00:13:51.610
The Iraqw of Tanzania see themselves
as having a Mediterranean origin,

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:53.320
not an African one.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:57.090
And this racial conflict
between the two groups

00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:02.820
was something that became important
in the Rwandan genocide of 1994.

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:07.761
It was much easier for the Hutu
to see the Batusi as foreign,

00:14:07.761 --> 00:14:11.155
as literally non-African invaders
of their own country,

00:14:11.155 --> 00:14:15.148
and made it that much easier for them
to exterminate them.

00:14:15.148 --> 00:14:18.150
I'm not saying that's the only reason
for the Rwandan genocide,

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.070
but it was one of the important factors.

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:21.990
So that's the sad part of the story.

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:24.903
But there's another part
and I want to end on this other part,

00:14:24.903 --> 00:14:26.903
which is an interesting part of the story,

00:14:26.903 --> 00:14:30.343
which is we really haven't actually gotten
back to the original question,

00:14:30.343 --> 00:14:32.583
which was: if these things aren't true,

00:14:32.583 --> 00:14:36.747
if Stanley wasn't actually seeing
white people in the heart of Africa,

00:14:36.747 --> 00:14:38.979
then what was he seeing?

00:14:38.979 --> 00:14:42.711
So I went to Africa in 2013,

00:14:42.711 --> 00:14:45.801
and I actually climbed that mountain
that Stanley was looking at,

00:14:45.801 --> 00:14:48.031
which I was totally unprepared for.

00:14:48.031 --> 00:14:51.151
I mean, I run; I thought
I was in pretty good shape,

00:14:51.151 --> 00:14:54.791
but this mountain is 17,000 feet high!

00:14:54.791 --> 00:14:58.489
There is a glacier on the top of it,
and I wasn't really prepared for that.

00:14:58.489 --> 00:15:02.250
But here I am before I got to that point.

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:03.610
(Laughter)

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:07.950
And I wanted to see, as I told my guide,
I wanted to see what Stanley saw,

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:11.450
and my guide, who was a member
of the Bakonzo tribe, he looked at me

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:14.735
and said: "There's no white people
on the top of that mountain, man."

00:15:14.735 --> 00:15:15.555
(Laughter)

00:15:15.555 --> 00:15:17.429
And I said, "I know that there aren't."

00:15:17.429 --> 00:15:19.439
But I want to think about
what Stanley saw.

00:15:19.439 --> 00:15:24.999
I came up with a provisional hypothesis,
and the provisional hypothesis is this:

00:15:24.999 --> 00:15:29.093
I think Stanley did see difference;
I think he did look at people and said,

00:15:29.093 --> 00:15:32.173
"These people do not look
anything like these people."

00:15:32.173 --> 00:15:34.725
We now know that in terms
of human diversity,

00:15:34.725 --> 00:15:38.085
Africa is the most diverse
continent in the world.

00:15:38.085 --> 00:15:41.943
There's more human diversity,
i.e. physical diversity, in Africa

00:15:41.943 --> 00:15:43.223
than any other place

00:15:43.223 --> 00:15:47.523
because within Africa is a much longer
evolutionary period of time

00:15:47.523 --> 00:15:50.053
for the human species than outside of it.

00:15:50.053 --> 00:15:54.004
So I think he did see human difference,
and then it was filtered through -

00:15:54.004 --> 00:15:56.304
this is my own theory,
and I'm very proud of it -

00:15:56.304 --> 00:15:59.659
it filtered what I call
the Mr. Magoo Hypothesis.

00:15:59.659 --> 00:16:00.809
(Laughter)

00:16:00.809 --> 00:16:04.643
So for those of you who are too young
to remember Mr. Magoo,

00:16:04.643 --> 00:16:06.814
he was this Don Quixote-like figure

00:16:06.814 --> 00:16:10.214
who was so nearsighted
that you would stick him in a room,

00:16:10.214 --> 00:16:14.244
and he wouldn't really know where he was,
and he thought he was somewhere else,

00:16:14.244 --> 00:16:17.144
but everything that he, like,
bumped into or knocked into,

00:16:17.144 --> 00:16:19.998
he interpreted as if he
was in that other place

00:16:19.998 --> 00:16:23.918
because his expectations
of where he was were so strong

00:16:23.918 --> 00:16:26.958
it filtered virtually
all information coming in.

00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:31.507
And I think that almost all explorers -
probably all tourists -

00:16:31.507 --> 00:16:33.887
suffer from the Mr. Magoo hypothesis,

00:16:33.887 --> 00:16:37.392
which is that they too, in a sense,
filter everything they see

00:16:37.392 --> 00:16:39.792
through their expectations
of what they should see.

00:16:39.792 --> 00:16:41.835
And I think Stanley, in a sense,

00:16:41.835 --> 00:16:46.035
wanted to see people
who were like him, who were European.

00:16:46.035 --> 00:16:50.505
He was a desperately lonely man;
he was living in Africa for three years,

00:16:50.505 --> 00:16:54.327
oftentimes without anyone else
from Europe or North America,

00:16:54.327 --> 00:16:57.708
and I think in a sense,
he wanted to identify with people

00:16:57.708 --> 00:17:02.777
and saw this difference - cheekbones,
aquiline nose, lighter skin color -

00:17:02.777 --> 00:17:04.745
and traced that as white.

00:17:04.745 --> 00:17:09.845
Ultimately, to finish it off, why should
we remember this strange hypothesis?

00:17:09.845 --> 00:17:13.702
OK. It was a kind of inkblot test
for the way people looked at the world.

00:17:13.702 --> 00:17:17.510
But ultimately, I think we should
remember the Hamitic hypothesis

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:23.040
because when we think about
master races and Aryan domination,

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:28.721
we think about kind of the very short,
very violent history of Nazi Germany,

00:17:28.721 --> 00:17:33.221
but in fact, there was a much longer
and a much more profound racial theory

00:17:33.221 --> 00:17:36.763
that continues to exist today,
and that is the Hamitic hypothesis.

00:17:36.763 --> 00:17:38.033
Thanks very much.

00:17:38.033 --> 00:17:40.799
(Applause)
